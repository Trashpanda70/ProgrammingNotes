## Programming Notes

These are just some notes that I have for trying to learn new languages and I figured I would share them. They are very incomplete, but I'm trying to fill them in when I have time (and feel like taking notes on programming languages). These are mostly for people with at least some knowledge of programming.

Ruby was the first language added so I could learn it for RPG Maker purposes. Also note that the Java notes are more advanced because I've known the basics for a while. For more basic Java notes go [here](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/java/). Python notes will be added as soon as I get around to learning Python.

These notes are formatted for [Obsidian Note Taking Software](https://obsidian.md/).

The C++ section assumes basic C knowledge. I will not post my C notes since they contain screenshots of university materials and idk what the rules are and don't care to find out.
