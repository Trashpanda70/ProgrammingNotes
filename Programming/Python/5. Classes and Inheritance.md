Python supports classes and objects. Each object has a constructor via the `__init__` method.
- The parameter `self` on all defined methods in a class is a requirement. It represents the current instance of the object. It does not need to be named `self`, but that is the convention
	- When referring to properties in a class, using `self.property` is required, cannot just say `property`
- The fields of a class do not need to be explicitly defined like Java, but are set in the constructor
- A leading underscore by a field denotes that the property is intended to be used internally. This is not enforced but is more for self-documenting code and a note to other developers.
	- This essentially makes it an unenforced private variable
- To instantiate a class, use the name of the class and in parenthesis the initializer's arguments
	- `my_car = Car('blue', 'toyota')`
	- Can also use keyword arguments when creating a class for code readability
		- `my_car = Car(color='blue', brand='toyota')`

```python
class Car:
	# A class attribute, shared by all instances of this class
	num_wheels = 4

	def __init__(self, color, brand):
		self.color = color
		self.brand = brand
		self._mileage = 0

	def auction(self, msg):
		print(f"{self.color} {self.brand} for sale: {msg}")


	# Class methods are shared among all instances. Like static methods in Java
	# The calling class is the first argument instead of the object instance
	# These are called via an instance of the class, so "my_car.get_num_wheels()"
	
	@classmethod
	def get_num_wheels(cls):
		return cls.num_wheels


	# Static methods in Python are without a class or instance reference
	# Called on the class, so would be "Car.look()"
	# Can also be called by the instance. "my_car.look()" is valid
	
	@staticmethod
	def look():
		return "wow what a cool car"


	# A property is like a getter method
	# Turns the method mileage() into a read-only attribute of the same name
	# Only needed when some transformation needs to be done on the data
	# But shown here for demonstration purposes
	# However, This is necessary if a mandatory setter is wanted
	
	@property
	def mileage(self):
		return self._mileage


	# Allows a property to be set
	# Also only needed when non-trivial checks or actions need to be done 
	
	@mileage.setter
	def mileage(self, mileage):
		if (mileage < 0):
			raise ValueError('Cannot have negative mileage')
		self._mileage = mileage


	# Allows a property to be deleted
	# Getting an attribute after it has been deleted raises an AttributeError
	
	@mileage.deleter
	def mileage(self):
		del self._mileage
```

In the above code snippet, the property (getter), setter, and deleter are all optional. This applies for all fields in Python objects as the get/set/delete operations can be performed just by referring to the field.
```python
# Assuming the getter, setter, and deleter are not defined
my_car = Car('blue', 'toyota')
my_car.color = 'red' # Valid
del my_car.color # Valid
print(my_car.color) # Throws AttributeError
```

The only way to control what values are set to the property is a setter, since code can always do `my_car.color = X`. The setter, defined in the way it is in the original code snippet, ensures that any call like `my_car.color = X` goes through the setter. 
- If a method like `set_color(color)` is defined then it can be used, but it is not required to use and direct modification is still possible 
- The same applies for deleting

To completely prevent getting, setting, or deleting, define the appropriate method and have no action take place, or just do not execute the action. Some options are:
- A `pass` statement
- Throw an exception
- Add an `assert` statement to ensure the action is not taken
- Log the attempt

```python
def mileage(self):
	raise RuntimeError('Cannot access the mileage')

@mileage.setter
def mileage(self, mileage):
	pass

@mileage.deleter
def mileage(self):
	assert self._mileage == self._mileage
```


>Any method with leading and trailing double underscores like `__init__` or `__iter__` are called special methods (sometimes referred to as dunder methods). These live in user-controlled namespaces but are used by Python. Like how Python uses `__init__` to create objects without explicitly being called, or how it uses `__next__` when iterating without being explicitly called.
>
>It is alright to override these methods on occasion, but avoid creating custom method / function names with leading and trailing underscores

One use for these special "methods" (in this case a variable) is being able to write code that only executes when a specific file is run.
- For example, if you have a class definition and code inside that class, maybe that code should only be run when `python MyClass.py` is run, and not when the file is imported.
- To accomplish this check if `__name__` is `"__main__"`

```python
class MyClass:
	# class stuff

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print('This only runs when this is the main file ran by the interpreter')
```

### Inheritance
Python supports inheritance, and even multiple inheritance. Classes do not need to be in a separate file but they can be if more modularization is desired. 
- To specify the class(es) to inherit from, the syntax is `class ClassName(Parent1, Parent2)`
- If a child should inherit all the parent's definitions with no changes, just use the `pass` keyword in the class body
- Children automatically inherit their parent class's constructor including its arguments, but it can add additional arguments or change method definitions like the class constructor
- The `super()` function allows access to the parent class's methods that are overridden by the child. Calling `super()__init__()` calls the parent constructor

```python
# Assume there is a Human class that will act as the parent
class Human:
	species = "Homo Sapien"
	
	def __init__(self, name):
		self.name = name

	def say(self, msg):
		print(f"{self.name}: {msg}")

	@classmethod
	def get_species(cls):
		return cls.species

# And now a subclass superhero
class Superhero(Human):
	# Override allowed
	species = "Superhuman"

	def __init__(self, name, movie=False, 
				superpowers=["super strength", "flight"]):
		# Add additional attributes
		self.functional = True
		self.movie = movie
		self.superpowers = superpowers

		# Call the parent's constructor
		super().__init__(name)

	# Override the say method
	def say(self, msg):
		message = msg.upper()
		print(f"{self.name}: {message}!")

	# Define a new method
	def boast(self):
		for power in self.superpowers:
			print(f"I have the power of {power}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	sup = Superhero(name="Superman")

	if isinstance(sup, Human):
		print("I am a human")
	if type(sup) is Superhero:
		print("I am a superhero")
	
	# Call parent class method but use own class attribute
	print(sup.get_species()) # => "Superhuman"
```

##### Multiple Inheritance
A class can inherit from multiple different classes in Python. The main difference between multiple and single inheritance is how to work with the superclass in the initializer, or anywhere else.
- `super()` only works with one parent. 
	- More specifically is only goes to the next base class in the Method Resolution Order (MRO) list. This list is the order that Python searches classes for methods or attributes
	- The MRO is dynamic and can be updated. To retrieve it call `ClassName.__mro__`
- To amend `super()` not working, call each class constructor by manually invoking it's `__init__` method

For the below example, assume a `Bat` class exists and use the previous `Superhuman` class above
```python
# Inherits from Superhero (which inherits from Human) and Bat
class Batman(Superhero, Bat):
	def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
		# *args and **kwargs allow for an easy way to process all attrbitues
		Superhero.__init__(self, "anonymous", movie=True, 
							superpowers=["Wealthy"], *args, **kwargs)
		Bat.__init__(self, *args, can_fly=False, **kwargs)
		# Override name
		self.name = "Bruce Wayne"

	# Other class methods can be added as needed
	# Same would go for other class fields
```
