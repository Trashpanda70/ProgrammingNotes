## Conditionals
Python is indentation based which means there are no brackets or braces for conditionals.
- Semicolons are used to mark the end of the condition. 
- Else if is done using the keyword `elif`
- Parenthesis can be added around the condition but are not required
- Conditionals can also be used as an expression in a similar way that the ternary operator works in C-style languages
	- `my_var = "yes" if bool(x) else "false"`
	- There is no ternary operator in Python because of this

```python
# Normal conditional. Indetation important!
var = 5
if var > 10:
	print("your var is over 10")
elif var < 10:
	print("your var is under 10")
else:
	print("your var is 10")

# Conditional expression
var = 5
sign = "positive" if var >= 0 else "negative"

# Can have chained conditional expressions, but it's bad style
# This does the same as the normal conditonal above
var = 5
string = "over 10" if var > 10 else "under 10" if var < 10 else "10"
print(f"your var is {string}")
```
