### Lists
One type of collection in Python is a list. In core Python, there are no arrays but rather you treat lists as flexible arrays. There are libraries that provide arrays similar to that of C and Java, but those need to be imported.
- A List can hold many different data types
- Lists are flexible in size
- Access elements in a list like you would an array in other languages
	- `my_list[0]`
- Lists are zero indexed like in most other languages

Below are a few ways to create a list
```python
# Empty list
li = []
# Start with values
li = [1, 2, 3]

# Use List constructor list()
# Allows you to create a list from a string or other collections
li = list()         # empty list
li = list("string") # ['s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']

# Can create a list from another list - retains order
li = list(list("string")) # ['s', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g']

# Can create a list from tuples - retains order
li = list(tuple(range(5))) # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# order will be random from other collections
vowel_set = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
vowel_dict = {'a': 1, 'e': 2, 'i': 3, 'o': 4, 'u': 5}
li = list(vowel_set)  # ['u', 'o', 'i', 'a', 'e']

# Will use the keys from a map / dictionary
li = list(vowel_dict) # ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']

# Similar constructors exist for other collections as well
```

There are many unique ways of modifying lists in Python, but also some that are more traditional of other common programming languages. Below are some common functions for modifying lists:
- `list.append(e)` - Add element to end of a list
- `list.pop()` - Remove the last element in the list
- `list.remove(e)` - Remove the *first occurrence* of an element from a list
	- Raises ValueError if the element is not in the list
- `list.insert(idx, e)` - Insert an element at the specified index of the list
- `list.index(e)` - Get the index of the first occurrence of an element from the list
	- Raises a ValueError if the element is not in the list
- `list.extend(li)` - Concatenates the list `li` to the end of the list
	- Raises a TypeError if `li` is not a list. 
	- So this does not work for single values (use `append` instead)
	- This can also be done with the `+` operator
		- `my_list + li == my_list.extend(li)`
- `len(li)` - Get the length of a list
- Use the `del` keyword to remove arbitrary elements from the list
	- `del my_list[1]`
- Check for existence in a list with `in` 
	- `5 in my_list`

There are some other quirks to Python lists as shown below, including slicing:
```python
# Note about del:
# Can use it for multiple indexes, but be careful as each is a separate operation
# Assume we want to remove even numbers
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
del li[1], li[3] # => [1, 3, 4]
del li[1], li[2] # => [1, 3, 5]

# Can use negative indexing
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
li[-1] # 5
li[-3] # 3

# Going out of bounds produces an IndexError
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
li[10]  # Error
li[-10] # Error

# But using an out of bounds index for insert does not matter
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
li.insert(10, 10)
li.insert(-10, -10)
print(li) # [-10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]

# SLICING
# Can retrieve ranges with slicing syntax, does not modify the list
# list[start:end:step]
# Note that start is inclusive and end is exclusive
li = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
li[1:3]  # From indexes 1 to 3           => [2, 3]
li[2:]   # Starting from index 2         => [3, 4, 5]
li[:3]   # Until index 3                 => [1, 2, 3]
li[::2]  # Step of 2                     => [1, 3, 5]
li[1::2] # Step of 2 starting at index 1 => [2, 4]
li[::-1] # Reverse order                 => [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
li[::-2] # Reverse order step of 2       => [5, 3, 1]

# Can use the slice operator to make a shallow copy
li2 = li[:]
# li2 == li => True
# li2 is li => False
```

### Tuples
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable. Most list operations can also be performed on tuples (excluding the ones that change the tuples like `append`)
- Tuples are a common way to return more than one value from a function, since the "value" returned is the tuple but it can contain multiple values within
	- Works better than lists (or arrays in other languages) because they are immutable
- Tuples are declared using parenthesis around a list of values as opposed to brackets or braces
	- A tuple with only 1 value must have a trailing comma, this does not apply for tuples of any other length (including 0)

```python
tup = (1, 2, 3)
tup = (1) # will evaluate to just 1, not a tuple
tup = (1,)
tup = ()
tup = 1, 2, 3 # Tuple created by default if no parenthesis used

# Tuples can be unpacked into variables
# This can be done with lists too
a, b, c = (1, 2, 3) # a == 1, b == 2, c == 3

# Can also do extended unpacking
a, *b, c = (1, 2, 3, 4) # a == 1, b == [2, 3], c == 4
# Note that b is a list, not a tuple

# Very easy to swap values around using tuple syntax
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
c, a = a, c # a == 3, b == 2, c == 1
```

### Sets
Sets are, by definition, an unordered collection of values. Therefore the main uses of a set are just to store things and check for existence. However, set operations such as union, intersection, and more are available.
- Create an empty set by using the `set()` constructor, since empty curly braces will create an empty dictionary
	- The constructor can take an optional tuple, list, or iterable to pre-populate the set with some values
	- Using curly braces to manually initialize a set with values is valid syntax, the interpreter will recognize that it's a set and not a dictionary
		- `my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4}` 
- `add(e)` - Add an element to the set
- Sets cannot contain duplicate values, so adding an element to a set that already contains that element will provide no change
- Check for existence in a set using the `in` keyword
	- `e in my_set`

Below are some more set operations that are available
```python
# Set Union
{1, 2} | { 3, 4} # {1, 2, 3, 4}
{1, 2, 3} | {3}  # {1, 2, 3}

# Set Intersection
{1, 2, 3} & {2, 3, 4} # {2, 3}
{1, 2, 3} & {4, 5, 6} # {} -- empty set, would actually be set() since {} == dict

# Set Difference
{1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 5} # {1, 4}

# Set Symmetric Difference
{1, 2, 3, 4} - {2, 3, 5} # {1, 4, 5}

# Check if the set on the left is a superset of the set on the right
{1, 2} >= {1, 2, 3} # False
{4, 5, 6} >= {5}    # True
{1, 2} >= set()     # True

# Check if the set on the left is a subset of the set on the right
{1, 2} <= (1, 2, 3) # True
```

### Dictionaries / Maps
Both refer to the same thing. Maps are a common term in some languages (Java included), but a dictionary and map is the same thing. Since they are called dictionaries (or dicts) in Python, that's what they will be called here. They are a collection of key-value pairs that can be used for quick indexing when consecutive numbers like a list is not suitable for the need.
- Dictionary keys ***must be immutable types*** 
	- Includes ints, floats, strings, and tuples
	- If a mutable type, like a list, is used then a TypeError is thrown
- Dictionaries are created using curly braces
- Looking up a value in a dictionary uses list syntax with brackets
	- `my_dict[value]`

```python
# Empty dict
empty_dict = {}
# Start with values
filled_dict = {"one", 1, "two", 2, "three", 3}

# Using the dict constructor allows for ommiting the quotes on string key names
# Quotes are still needed to reference them though
x = dict(one = 1, two = 2, three = 3)
x["one"] # 1
```

Below are some different methods for interacting with a dictionary in Python. Some of these are similar or the same as their respective operations for lists
- `dict.update({k, v})` - Add the key value pair to the dict
	- Can also be accomplished using list syntax `dict[k] = v`
	- You cannot add an element to a list using this syntax, this is only for dicts
- `dict.get(k)` - Returns the value with the associate key, or `None` if the key does not exist
	- This is safer than referencing using list syntax since that will throw a KeyError if the value does not exist
	- Can add a default value for if the key does not exist by using `get(k, val)`
		- `val` will be returned instead of `None` if the key is not in the dict
- `dict.setdefault(k, v)` - The same as `update` but will not override the value if it exists in the dictionary
	- No error is thrown if the value exists, it will just simply not update the value
- `len(dict)` - Get the number of entries in a dictionary
- `dict.keys()` -  Get all keys as an iterable, need to use `list()` to get them as a list
	- `list(my_dict.keys())`
- `dict.values()` - Get all values as an iterable, need to use `list()` to get them as a list
	- `list(my_dict.values())`
	- Note that for `values` and `keys` the order is only guaranteed in Python versions 3.7+
- Use the `del` keyword to remove an entry from a dictionary
	- `del my_dict(k)`
- Check for existence in a dict using the `in` keyword
	- `k in my_dict`
	- Only works to check for keys

### Copying and References

> Tuples are excluded from this section, but it applied to Lists, Sets, and Dictionaries

To make a copy of a collection, use either `copy()` or `copy.deepcopy()`. `copy` makes a shallow copy and `copy.deepcopy` makes a deep copy. 
- ***Shallow Copy*** - Creates a copy of the collection but not anything *inside* the collection. This means any objects will point to the same memory
- ***Deep Copy*** - A recursive operation that creates a copy of the collection and the objects inside the collection
	- Note that to use the `deepcopy()` method, you must import the `copy` module
	- This can be done with `import copy`

This means that modifications to the *objects* inside a shallow copy are reflected in the original. Collections *are* objects. Below shows the implications of this and can demonstrate the differences between the methods of copying. 
- The example uses lists but this would also apply to Sets and Dictionaries

```python
# Without using any copy method
a = [1, [2, 2], 3]
b = a
b == a # True
b is a # True
b.append(4)
print(a) # [1, [2, 2], 3, 4]
# Without using any copy method, b and a point to the same memory. 
# Modifying b means modifying a and vice versa.
# That means "b is a" will always be True

# Using copy()
a = [1, [2, 2], 3]
b = a.copy()
b == a # True
b is a # False
b.append(4)
print(a) # [1, [2, 2], 3]
# Using copy, they no longer point to the same memory. 
# So changes to b are not reflected in a. 
# However, the List at a[1] is an object. This means it didnt get copied.
# Changes to a[1] get reflected in b[1] since they are references
b[1] is a[1] # True
b[1].append(4)
print(a) # [1, [2, 2, 4], 3]

# Using copy.deepcopy()
import copy
a = [1, [2, 2], 3]
b = copy.deepcopy(a)
b == a # True
b is a # False
b[1] is a[1] # False
b[1].append(4)
print(a) # [1, [2, 2], 3]
# With a deep copy, a[1] gets copied to b[1] not just the reference
# This would apply recursively to any level of nested objects
```
