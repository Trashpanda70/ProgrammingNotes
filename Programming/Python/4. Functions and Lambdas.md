New functions can be created with the `def` keyword. They follow the same indentation principles as conditionals and loops. Python functions need to be defined before use. So a function defined in line 10 cannot be used in line 5 of the same file, for example.
- Python supports functions with a variable number of arguments. This is achieved by putting a `*` in front of the argument name. 
	- Must be last in the method header
	- The arguments are sent to the function as a **tuple**, meaning their value cannot be changed in the function
	- By convention, the parameter is just named `args`, but this is not a rule
- Multiple values can be returned from a function. They are inherently returned as a tuple.
	- Do not need to include the tuple parenthesis but they are allowed
- Python supports optional arguments

```python
def func(x, y, *args):
	print(x) # => 1
	print(y) # => 2
	print(args) # => (5, 6, 7)
	return y, x # Notice how y is returned first

my_x, my_y = func(1, 2, 5, 6, 7) # Assign function return to tuple values
print(my_x) # => 2
print(my_y) # => 1

# Optional arguments example
def func(num, mult=1):
	return num * mult

print(func(4)) # => 4
print(func(4, 2)) # => 8
```

##### Keyword Arguments
Python also supports keyword arguments. This allows for calling a function with the argument order different from the method header, as the argument values are explicitly stated 
- Keyword arguments must always be after positional arguments, that is, explicitly setting parameter values must only happen after implicit ones
- Cannot set a variable argument parameter in this way 
- All non-keyword arguments given to a function are *positional arguments*

```python
def my_func(x, y, z, *args):
	print(x, y, z)
	print(args)

my_func(1, 2, z=3) # Valid
my_func(y=2, z=3, x=1) # Valid
my_func(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # Valid

my_func(x=1, 2, 3) # Invalid
my_func(1, 2, z=3, 4, 5) # Invalid
my_func(x=1, y=2, z=3, args=(4, 5)) # Invalid
my_func(x=1, y=2, z=3, args=4) # Invalid
```

Combining variable arguments and keyword arguments is allowed
- Use `**` in front of the argument name
- By convention, the parameter is named `kwargs`
- These are passed into the function as a **dictionary**

```python
def func(**kwargs):
	if "a" in kwargs:
		print("a found")
	else:
		print("No a.")

func(a=1, c=2) # a found
func(a="my string") # a found
func(b=4) # no a
func() # no a

# Having both *args and **kwargs is allowed thought
# Just know that kwargs have to come last
def arguments(*args, **kwargs):
	print(args)
	print(kwargs)

args = (1, 2, 3, 4)
kwargs = { "a": 5, "b": 10}
arguments(args, kwargs)
```

##### Expanding Arguments
Essentially performing the opposite of *args* and *kwargs*, by expanding a tuple or map into positional or keyword arguments. This is done by putting `*` or `**` respectively by the parameter being passed in

```python
# With args
def func(x, y, z):
	print(x, y, z)

tup = (1, 2, 3)
func(*tup) # => func(1, 2, 3)

# With kwargs
def my_func(a, b):
	print(a, b)

map = {"a": 5, "b": 10}
my_func(**map) # => my_func(a=5, b=10)
```

##### Global Keyword
Functions have their own scope in Python. Once a function is entered the scope becomes limited to that function. The **global** keyword indicates a particular variable lives in global scope.
- This is necessary for using already defined global variables in a function

```python
def func(x):
	global var
	print(var)
	num = x * 10
	var 

func(5)
# num doesnt need to be defined since it is globally defined in func
print(num) # => 50
```

##### First Class Functions
A first class function is a function that is assigned to a variable value. Python supports these, and it allows for passing functions as parameters for use inside another function or for returning a function from another function.

```python
def func_creator():
	def func(name):
		print('Hello ' + name)
	return func
	
my_func = func_creator()
my_func('john') # Prints 'Hello john'


def create_adder(x):
	def adder(y):
		return x + y
	return adder

my_func = create_adder(10)
x = my_func(5)
print(x) # => 15
```

To use a variable inside a nested function from it's outer function, use the `nonlocal` keyword
- Behaves similar to global but the variable must already be defined in the outer function
- If functions are doubly nested or more, it will use the "closest" function's value
	- That is to say the most nested function with that variable name that is above the nonlocal declaration in scope
- This applies even if the function is returned as a variable and called later

```python
# Without nonlocal
def outer():
	x = 1
	def inner():
		x = 2
		print('inner:', x) # 2
	inner()
	print('outer:', x) # 1
	return inner

outer()

# With nonlocal
def outer():
  x = 1
  def inner():
    nonlocal x # x will now refer to the x defined in outer
    x = 2
    print('inner:', x) # 2    
  inner()
  print('outer:', x) # 2

outer()
```

### Lambdas / Anonymous Functions
Python supports anonymous functions via the `lambda` keyword. They are functions not assigned to a variable or defined with `def`, intended for one time use. 

```python
(lambda x: x > 2)(3) # => True
(lambda x, y: x ** y)(2, 3) # => 8

# The general layout is as follows
(lambda param1, param2, paramN: func_body )(param1, param2, paramN)
```

Lambdas can also be used as parameters for certain functions like `map` and `filter`

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

list(map(lambda x: x * 10, my_list)) # [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, my_list)) # [2, 4]
```

##### Comprehensions
These can be used to make a new collection out of a pre-existing collection, while leaving the old collection unchanged. They can be applied to Lists, Sets, and Dicts.

```python
# Syntax is generally
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]

# Basic list comprehension
# No condition specified so it is applied to all elements
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
new_list = [add_10(i) for i in my_list] # => [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Basic set comprehension
new_dict = {x for x in "abbcddeef" if x not in "abc"} # => {'d', 'e', 'f'}

# Basic dict comprehension
# Notice how it makes a dict from a range, so changing the collection is allowed
{str(x): x**2 for x in range(5)} # => {'0': 0, '1': 1, '2': 4, '3': 9, '4': 16}

# Comprehensions can get complicated and do a lot in one line
# Finds all prime numbers that end in 3 from 0-99, assuming isPrime() exists
nums = [x for x in list(filter(lambda x: x % 10 == 3, range(100))) if isPrime(x)]
print(nums) # => [3, 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, 83]
```
