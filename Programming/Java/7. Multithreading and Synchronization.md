Java supports multithreading via the *thread* class, allowing the creation of multiple threads in a program. Java runtime takes care of creating the machine-level instructions and works with the OS to have them execute in parallel.

There are two types of threads
- **User Thread**: The main threads of an application. A single user thread is started when the JVM starts, this starts at the `main` method. When all user threads are executed, the JVM terminates the program
- **Daemon Thread**: A background thread that provides services to the user thread. They are low priority threads that perform background operations such as garbage collection, action listeners, signal dispatchers, etc. When all user threads are stopped, the daemon threads are also stopped
	- A daemon thread's status is gained from it's parent, so a user thread cannot spawn a daemon thread. Use the `setDaemon(boolean)` method to make a thread a daemon thread, and any threads it spawns will also be daemon threads.

#### Thread Properties
- Threads have their own stack, but share heap space
- If a singular thread, or even the parent thread encounter an exception, the other threads will not stop execution

### Starting a Thread
You can start a thread in a few ways. One way would be using lambdas, and another way would be manually implementing the thread class and overriding the `run` method.
- Note to start a thread you must use the `start` method and NOT `run`
	- Using `run` will not actually create a new thread 
```java
//implement Thread
public class Multithread extends Thread {
	@Override
    public void run() {  
        //thread code
    } 

	//can be in a different class, just here for simplicity
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Multithread t = new Multithread();  
        t.start(); 
    }  
}

//Can also do this via a lambda
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {  
    //thread code
});  
t.start();

//If the above syntax is confusing, look back at the lambda notes
//The below code is doing the same thing as the above, but more clear
Runnable r = () -> {  
    //thread code 
};  
Thread t = new Thread(r);  
t.start();
```

> Runnable is a functional interface with the singular method `run`, to create a thread, you pass an *implementation* of the `run` method to the thread constructor. This can be done using lambda syntax just like any other lambda statement. 
> 
> This also means you can use a method reference to start a thread.  

You can also start a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface instead of extending the `Thread` class. Everything would be the same except when starting the thread you need an extra line.
- The advantage of implementing Runnable is allowing the custom thread class to extend another class, Because Java does not allow multiple inheritance, if MyClass extended `Thread` then it could not extend another class.
```java
//Implementing Runnable
MyClass m = new MyClass(); //Custom class that implements Runnable 
Thread t = new Thread(myClass); //create thread from custom class
t.start();

//Extending Thread
MyClass m = new MyClass(); //Custom class that extends Thread
m.start();
```

#### Thread Sleep
You can halt a thread temporarily via the `Thread.sleep(long)` method
- The parameter is the number of milliseconds to have the thread sleep for
- Java requires a try-catch around the sleep method as it could throw an *InterruptedException* if another thread interrupts it while it is asleep
	- The same applies to the `join` method, and others.
```java
try {  
    Thread.sleep(1000); //sleep for 1 second  
} catch (InterruptedException e) {  
	//handle exception or just propagate it
    throw new RuntimeException(e);  
}
```

### Parameters
The following program uses 3 threads that each count from 0-4.
```java
public class Multithread extends Thread {  
    public void run() {  
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
            System.out.println(i);  
            try {  
                Thread.sleep(500);  
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {  
                throw new RuntimeException(e);  
            }  
        }  
    }  
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
	    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
		    Multithread t = new Multithread();  
	        t.start();
	    } 
	}
}
```

What if we change this code so that we can tell which thread a number comes from when it is printed to the console? To do this, we can pass parameters into the thread upon it's creation via making a constructor in the `Multithread` class.
- The same can be done via a lambda statement, but it becomes more complicated. It involves creating a separate method to take in the parameters passed into the thread
- When using a lambda to select a method to run the thread with, the variables passed in must be final or effectively final.
	- This does not apply when using a constructor in a custom thread class
- As the thread code becomes more complex, or more information needs to be passed in, using a lambda becomes more tedious than it's worth. They should be used for simple threads.
- FOR THIS EXAMPLE/PROBLEM: A thread name would solve this issue. When using the `Thread` constructor you can pass in a parameter that is the thread's name. This is shown below. For more complex threads that need more data this will not work.

```java
//using a constructor
public class Multithread extends Thread {  
	
	int threadNum;  //field variable
	
	public Multithread(int threadNum) {  
	    this.threadNum = threadNum;  
	}  
	  
	public void run() {  
	    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
	        System.out.println(i + " from thread " + threadNum);  
	        try {  
	            Thread.sleep(500);  
	        } catch (InterruptedException e) {  
	            throw new RuntimeException(e);  
	        }  
	    }  
	}  
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
	    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {  
	        Multithread t = new Multithread(i); //pass in thread number
	        t.start();  
	    }
	}
}

//using a lambda
public class Multithread {
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
	        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {  
	            final int threadNum = i;  //need variable to be final
	            //could not use method reference from static context
	            //assuming context is not static method reference would work
	            //i.e. --> this::count(threadNum)
	            Thread th = new Thread(() -> count(threadNum));  
	            th.start();  
	        }  
	    } 
	 }
	//separate method, acts as what is called from the run() method of the thread
	private static void count(int threadNum) {  
		for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  
			System.out.println(i + " from thread " + threadNum);  
			try {  
				Thread.sleep(500);  
			} catch (InterruptedException e) {  
				throw new RuntimeException(e);  
			}  
		}  
	}
}

//using a lambda with a thread name parameter
public class Multithread {
	public static void main(String[] args) {  
		for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {  
			Thread th = new Thread(() -> {  
				for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++) { 
					//split string to make it look neater in notes
					String str = k + " from ";
					//get current thread's name to print
					System.out.println(str + Thread.currentThread().getName());  
					try {  
						Thread.sleep(500);  
					} catch (InterruptedException e) {  
						throw new RuntimeException(e);  
					}  
				}  
			}, "thread " + i); //pass in thread's name here 
			th.start();  
		}  
	}
}
```

#### Thread Join
The `join` method allows for one thread to wait for the execution of another thread. This is mainly used to have the parent thread wait for the threads it spawns to finish executing before continuing it's code execution.
- `join` also takes a parameter for a number of milliseconds. If provided, the wait time will be either until the thread is finished or until the number of milliseconds has passed, whichever comes first
- The below example creates 3 threads, runs the first 2, and the third is executed when the first 2 finish
	- If the calls to `join()` were replaced with `join(3000)` then the third thread would wait 3 seconds OR until threads 1 and 2 were finished
```java
Multithread t1 = new Multithread(1);  
Multithread t2 = new Multithread(2);  
Multithread t3 = new Multithread(3);  
  
try {  
	//start first 2 threads
    t1.start();  
    t2.start(); 
    //wait for them to finish 
    t1.join();  
    t2.join(); 
    //start 3rd thread 
    t3.start();  
} catch (InterruptedException e) {  
	//need catch block for join() method
    throw new RuntimeException(e);  
}
```

### Callable and Future

If Run is a void method, then how can we return a value from a thread back to the main thread? The answer is that, you can't technically. There are a few workarounds.
- Pass an object to the thread, change the object in the thread, and call `join` to wait for the thread to stop before accessing the new value(s)
- Use a volatile variable / array and use `join` to wait for the threads to stop
- Use Callable / Future

`Callable` is a functional interface, like `Runnable`, except it uses generics to allow for a return type, and has a `throws` clause in the method header.
- You can remove this from your implemented `call` method if nothing is thrown

The following code demonstrates the use of `Callable`. Each thread multiplies the number passed to it by a random number 2-9 three times and then returns the result. The threads print and sleep so their execution can be seen more clearly.
```java
public class Multithread implements Callable<Integer> {  
    private int num;  
  
    public Multithread(int num) {  
        this.num = num;  
    }  
  
    @Override  
    public Integer call() {  
        Random rand = new Random();  
        int newNum = num; 
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {  
            System.out.println("processing " + num);  
            try {  
                Thread.sleep(500);  
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {  
                throw new RuntimeException(e);  
            }  
            newNum = rand.nextInt(2, 10) * newNum;  
        };  
        return newNum;  
    }  
  
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
	    //create threads 
        Multithread m1 = new Multithread(1);  
        Multithread m2 = new Multithread(2);  
        Multithread m3 = new Multithread(3);  
        //create an ExecutorService with a thread pool of our defined theads
        ExecutorService service = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);  
        try {  
	        //create a list of the threads to send to the Executor
            List<Callable<Integer>> threadList = List.of(m1, m2, m3);  
            //invoke all threads, returns a list of Future objects
            List<Future<Integer>> futures = service.invokeAll(threadList); 
            //go through the Future objects and print the results
            //Future.get blocks - no worries about manually preventing execution 
            for (Future<Integer> f : futures) {  
                System.out.println(f.get());  
            }  
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {  
            e.printStackTrace();  
        } catch (ExecutionException e) {  
            throw new RuntimeException(e);  
        } finally {  
            service.shutdown();  
        }  
    }  
}
```

- `Future.get` is a blocking call, so no need to worry about the main thread executing the print statement before the threads are done computing.
	- `Future.get` also will throw an ExecutionException if the `call` method in the thread threw an exception. This is why `call` has `throws Exception` in it's header. In this case no checked exceptions are thrown by `call` so it got removed.
	- Both `Future.get` and `invokeAll` require a try-catch for `InterruptedException`
- Shutting down the service helps free resources the threads use and prevent memory leaks and resource blocking. It should always be done when a service is done executing.
	- the `shutdown` method provides a graceful shutdown. `shutdownNow` can be used for an immediate shutdown in the case of a thread taking too long to shutdown or in an emergency.
- There are a few more notes about the Executors as well:

```java
//If only a single thread is needed, can use the following
//as opposed to newFixedThreadPool, although using newFixedThreadPool(1) is valid
ExecutorService service = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

//to submit a single thread instead of all, use submit()
//as opposed to invokeAll()
//can do this multiple times at different intervals if needed
service.submit(thread1);
```
