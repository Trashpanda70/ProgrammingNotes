### Lambdas
Lambdas allow for method implementations to be saved as variables in Java. This is essentially the closest to a Javascript callback that Java has. The following example illustrates what lambdas are doing.
- Assume there is an interface `Printable` with a parameterless method `print`
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {  
	//save method implementation into variable
    Printable printable = () -> System.out.println("message");  
    //pass implementation as parameter
    //could directly insert lambda expression as variable
    callPrint(printable);  
}  
public static void callPrint(Printable p) {  
    p.print();  
}
```

Note that it is the method ***implementation*** that is being passed, this is important for when parameters get involved. The line containing the `printable` variable declaration would see parameters added to the parenthesis, but their value would not be defined in the `main` method, but rather the `callPrint` method. See the below example.
- Assume the `print` method now has 1 parameter, the message to print
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {  
	//can exclude parenthesis if only 1 parameter is used
    Printable printable = m -> System.out.println(m);  
    callPrint(printable);  
}  
public static void callPrint(Printable p) {  
    p.print("the message I am printing");  
}
```
- Notice how `m` is not defined in `main` but rather it's value is passed into the lambda implementation in the `callPrint` method
- This becomes more evident in the next example below
	- Assume `print` takes 2 parameters, strings to print before and after the message
```java
public static void main(String[] args) { 
	//the lambda requires parenthesis for the body if it's more that one line
    Printable printable = (b, a) -> {  
        System.out.println(b);  
        System.out.println("This is the message");  
        System.out.println(a);  
    };  
    callPrint(printable);  
}  
public static void callPrint(Printable p) {  
    p.print("param before", "param after");  
}
```

When adding return types to the lambda, there are 2 possible ways to return it
- Normally at the end of the lambda
- If the lambda is only one line, then an expression can be substituted and interpreted as the return value / implementation
To see an example of this, the same `print` method as above is used, but it returns the full printed message.
```java
//returning at the end of the lambda
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    Printable printable = (b, a) -> {  
        String msg = b + " this is the message" + a;  
        System.out.println(msg);  
       return msg;  
    };  
    callPrint(printable);  
}  
public static void callPrint(Printable p) {  
    p.print("param before", "param after");  
}

//returning as an expression
//this time nothing is printed because that would require 2 statements, the print and the return
public static void main(String[] args) {  
	//declaring the types of the parameters is not required 
	//but it can be good practice for making code readable
    Printable printable = (String b, String a) -> b + " this is the message" + a;  
    callPrint(printable);  
    //the below code is exactly the same as the above
    Printable printable = (b, a) -> {
	    String msg = b + " this is the message" + a;
	    return msg;
    };  
    callPrint(printable);  
}  
public static void callPrint(Printable p) {  
    p.print("param before", "param after");  
}

//this is more useful for streams, example using the map function
//Square every element in the stream and make that the new value
stream.map(n -> Math.pow(n, 2));
```

> Lambdas can only be used with *Functional Interfaces*. A functional interface is an interface with exactly one defined method, like the theoretical `Printable` interface with a `print` method. An interface can be marked as functional with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation above it's header, but it is not required.
> 
> This constraint is due to the fact that you can only define the implementation of one method in a lambda, so using it with an interface that has more than one method would break the rule for interfaces that all method declarations must be implemented in interface implementations

#### Method References
The following is a simplified lambda expression from the above examples:
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {   
    callPrint(m -> System.out.println(m));  
}  
```

Instead of explicitly calling `System.out.println()`, you can use a method reference instead
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	callPrint(System.out::println);
}
```

From the Oracle documentation:

>You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method. In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name. Method references enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods that already have a name.

Essentially, a method reference can be used instead of a lambda that only calls an existing function. It makes the code cleaner, and is not required but is good style. There are different kinds of method references:
- `SomeType::staticMethodName` - reference to a static method (you refer to the static method of "SomeType" class);
- `someTypeInstance::instanceMethodName` - reference to the instance method of a particular object (here, you need an _actual_ object, from which you obtain the method reference);
	- Instance method of an object
- `SomeType::instanceMethod` - reference to the instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type (you do not need to explicitly create an object in this case);
-  `SomeType::new` - reference to the constructor (you simply refer to the constructor).
Or displayed in code:
```java
SomeType::staticMethodName == x -> SomeType.staticMethodName(x)

someTypeInstance::instanceMethodName == 
x -> someTypeInstance.instanceMethodName(x)

SomeType::instanceMethod == x -> x.instanceMethod()
//extra example to show
SomeType::instanceMethod == (x, y) -> x.instanceMethod(y)

SomeType::new == x -> new X()
```

### Streams API
Streams simplify doing certain operations such as sorting, filtering, and mapping sequences, and can be used to set an order to those operations and/or have them executed in parallel.
- Can be imported with `import java.util.stream.*`
#### Create a Stream
```java
//create an empty stream
Stream<String> streamEmpty = Stream.empty();

//from a collection (List, Set, Map, any kind)
Stream<String> streamOfCollection = collection.stream();

//from an Array
Stream<String> streamOfArray = Stream.of("val1", "val2", "val3");
//from an entire predefined array
Stream<String> streamOfArrayFull = Arrays.stream(arr);
//from part of a predefined array (between indexes n and n+1)
Stream<String> streamOfArrayPart = Arrays.stream(arr, 1, 3); //indexes 1 and 2
```

#### Terminal Operations
As long as only intermediate operations are called, you can reference a stream. However, once a *terminal* operation is called, referencing the stream produces an *IllegalStateException* which is a runtime error (i.e. not caught by the compiler)
- Terminal operations are stream operations that cannot be chained together (can't do `this.that().foo().bar()`), instead they mark the end of a stream's use. They generally return a primitive, collection, or nothing at all
	- forEach and forEachOrdered
	- toArray
	- reduce
	- collect
	- anyMatch
	- findFirst
	- and others
- Intermediate operations can be chained, and typically modify the data in some way but keep it as a stream
	- filter
	- map
	- sorted
	- peek
	- limit
	- skip
	- and others
- Using streams typically involves a few chained intermediate operations and a terminal operation

```java
String[] str = { "str6", "str1", "big3", "otherstring", "str2", "str5", "str4", "zendstring", "str3"};  

List<String> list = Arrays.asList(str);  
  
//steps one at a time  
//normally these would be chained together  
Stream<String> stream = list.stream();  
stream = stream.sorted(String::compareTo); //use the compareTo method  
stream = stream.filter(s -> s.contains("str")); //include only strings containing str  
stream = stream.limit(4); //limit to only 3 strings  
stream = stream.skip(1); //discard the first element  
stream = stream.map(s -> s + "0"); //add 0 to the end of every string  
stream.forEach(System.out::println); //terminal operation, print stream  
//prints str10 str20 str30
```
