### Big Decimal 
- Ways to represent extremely large, small, or precise numbers via an immutable signed decimal number
- Also used for situations that require accuracy such as financial transactions
- Has 2 parts: Unscaled Value and Scale
	- *Unscaled Value*: Integer (not Java integer but mathematical integer) that represents the number with no decimal points
	- *Scale*: How many digits are to the right of the decimal point
	- Example:
		- Number: `123456.789`
		- Unscaled Value: `123456789`
		- Scale: `3`

- Create a BigDecimal from a string, char array, int, long, or BigInteger
```java
BigDecimal bdFromString = new BigDecimal("0.1")
BigDecimal bdFromLong = new BigDecimal("132843248236478L")
```
- *Note that you should not create a BigDecimal from a double since doubles might not accurately represent decimal values, like how 0.1 cannot be represented in Binary. This could lead to errors* 
	- Better to use the string constructor instead
- Can convert a *double* or *long* to a BigDecimal using `valueOf()`
	- `BigDecimal dbFromDouble = BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1d)`

**Operations**
- Use methods for operations instead of operators
	- add, subtract, multiply, divide, compareTo

### Switch as an Expression
- Allows for simple switch blocks to be used as an expression. No need for `break` as the result of the switch statement is used as the simplified expression
	- A switch expression must be *exhaustive* meaning that all possible values are covered. Normally this just means a `default` clause is required, but for enum switch expressions the compiler will imply a `default` clause if all enum values are covered
	- Because a switch expression must evaluate to a single value, you cannot continue, break, or return inside of one
- **Example**: A switch statement and expression that gets the number of letters in the day of the week 
```java
public enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY; }
Day day = Day.WEDNESDAY;
int numLetters = 0;

// switch statement
switch (day) {
	case MONDAY:
	case FRIDAY:
	case SUNDAY:
		numLetters = 6;
		break;
	case TUESDAY:
		numLetters = 7;
		break;
	case WEDNESDAY:
		numLetters = 8;
		break;
	default:
		throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid day: " + day);
}

//switch expression
numLetters = switch (day) {
	case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
	case TUESDAY -> 7;
	case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> 8;
	case WEDNESDAY -> 9;
	default -> throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid day: " + day);
};

//can insert switch expression where normal expressions would be, like print statements
System.out.println(
	switch (day) {
		case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> 6;
		case TUESDAY -> 7;
		case THURSDAY, SATURDAY -> 8;
		case WEDNESDAY -> 9;
		default -> throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid day: " + day);
	}
);
```

### Try With Resources
- Allows you to automatically close resources used in a try block. No need for a `finally` to close PrintWriters or Scanners.

```java
try (Scanner sc = new Scanner(new FileInputStream(filename));
	 PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(filename)) {
	 //code here
} catch (IOException e) {
	 //handle exception
}
 //no need for finally block
```

### Records
- A record is a way to create an immutable class that can ensure data integrity without the boilerplate code of a POJO. 
	- All fields are private and final
- One can declare a record using the class name and fields, and the following are created automatically:
	- getter methods
	- constructor 
	- equals
	- hashcode
	- toString

```java
//full record declaration for simple rectangle class
record Rectangle(double len, double width) {}

//can create custom constructor or getters if necessary
record Rectangle(double len, double width) {
	//constructor
	public Rectangle {
		if (len <= 0 || width <= 0) {
			throw new IllegalArgumentException("Dimensions must be positive");
		}
		this.len = len;
		this.width = width;
	}
	//custom getter
	public double len() {
		System.out.println("Retrieved length " + len);
		return len;
	}
	//custom method
	public double getDoubleLen() {
		return len * 2;
	}
}

```

- **Rules about records:**
	- CAN create static fields and methods and they will behave as usual
	- CANNOT create non-static instance variables (fields) inside the record class
		- Not counting the ones created by the record header definition
	- CAN create a generic record class
		- `record Triangle<C extends Coordinate> (C top, C left, C right) {}`
	- CAN create a record class that implements one or more interfaces
		- `record Employee(...) implements Person {}`

### Optional Class

- A class that can be used to evaluate a value that will either be null or not null
- A type-level solution for representing optional values instead of null references
	- Can be used to ensure null dereference does not happen without explicitly checking for `val != null`
	- To check for a value use:
		- `isPresent()`  -- true if non-null
		- `isEmpty()` -- true if null
	- To get the value use `get()`
- Why use Optionals instead of null check?
	- Might forget to repeatedly do the null check
	- Optionals enforce good programming practice to ensure one does not happen

```java
//empty optional class
Optional<String> empty = Optional.empty();

//Optional from value
//Cannot pass null to of(), would get NullPointerException
String name = "matt";
Optional<String> opt = Optional.of(name);

//if value might be or is null, pass it to ofNullable()
String name = "matt";
Optional<String> opt = Optional.ofNullable(name);
String name2 = null;
Optional<String> opt2 = Optional.ofNullable(name2); 

//Can use ifPresent with a lambda to execute code
opt.ifPresent(name -> System.out.println(name.length()));

//Can use get() to get the value
if (opt.isPresent()) {
	name = opt.get();
}
```

**Default Value**
- Can use the `orElse()` method to specify a default value for the optional if it is null when checking
- Can also use `orElseGet()` which takes a supplier interface

```java
String name = Optional.ofNullable(name).orElse("matt");
String name = Optional.ofNullable(name).orElseGet(() -> "matt");

//For the most part these methods are the same
//They actually are the same if there is no value in the Optional

String myData = Optional.ofNullable(data).orElse(getDataFromWeb());
String myData = Optional.ofNullable(data).orElseGet(this::getDataFromWeb)
//if the data exists, the getDataFromWeb() method still executes when using orElse and not orElseGet, which can mean a big difference in runtime
```

### JVM vs. JDK vs. JRE

##### JDK - Java Development Kit
- All tools, executables, and binaries to compile, debug, and execute a Java program. 
- Platform specific
- Needed for Java development
- Contains JRE along with compiler, core classes, and debugger

##### JVM - Java Virtual Machine
- Responsible for converting byte code into machine code
- Platform specific, used to allow the same Java to be run on any platform
- Provides core functions such as memory management, garbage collection, security, and more

##### JRE - Java Runtime Environment
- The implementation of the JVM
- Needed to run Java programs
- Does not contain debugger, compiler, etc.
- If you just want to run Java programs, do not need JDK
