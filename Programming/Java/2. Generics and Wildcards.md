### Generics
- Used to explicitly state the type when it would normally be unspecified, helps the compiler with type enforcement
- Using a similar operator when creating Lists, such as `List<Integer> list = new LinkedList<>()`
	- Specified the list will hold integers
- Use a single letter, such as E, T, K, V, etc. to represent the generic

> Basically, if a method can be run with multiple types, using a generic will mean you dont need a new method for each type, but can ensure that the type is the same during runtime. Whether it is an Integer, Double, or custom class

#### Bounded Generics
- Restrict a generic to limit what types are accepted
- Commonly done with `CompareTo` and the `Comparable` interface
	- `public class <T extends Comparable<T>> ...`
- Can also have multiple constrictions
	- `public class <T extends Number<T> & Comparable<T>> ...`
	- If one of the types is a class (rather than an interface like Comparable) it must come first in the list of bounds
#### Uses
- Can be used in classes to define a type for the whole class
```java
//class
public class Map<K extends Comparable<K>, V> OrderedMap<K, V> {
	//...
}

//methods only
public <T> List<T> fromArrayToList(T[] a) {
	return Arrays.stream(a).collect(Collectors.toList());
}

//If need 2 generics declared, separate them with a comma
public <K, V> Map<K, V> myFunction(...) {
	//...
}
```

### Wildcards
- Represented by the question mark (?) 
- Used when Type is unknown, but could have super/subclasses involved

Why are wildcards necessary?
- Object is the supertype of all classes, but List\<Object> is not a supertype of List\<String>
- Assigning a List\<Object> to a variable of type List\<String> will generate a compile error
- Lets say there is a type `Building` and a subtype `House`. A method taking a List of Buildings cannot be used on a List of Houses
- Using an *upper bound wild card* can fix this
	- There is also a *lower bound wildcard*

```java
//works with Building and its subclasses
public static void processBuildings(List<? extends Building> buildings) {
	//...
}

//works with Dog and all its parent classes (Animal, Mammal)
public static void methodName(List<? super Dog> dogs) {
	//...
}
```
