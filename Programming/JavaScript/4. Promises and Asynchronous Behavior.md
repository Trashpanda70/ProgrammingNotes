### Asynchronous Behavior
Javascript is an asynchronous programming language meaning it can execute multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the execution of other tasks.

An example of this is the use of callbacks. A callback function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after the function has completed.

```js
function asyncTask(callback) { //accepting a function
  setTimeout(function() {
    //console.log("Asynchronous task completed");
    callback(); //do some operations then call callback (use of a callback function)
  }, 1000);
}

console.log("Starting task");
asyncTask(function() {
  console.log("Callback function executed");
});
console.log("Task completed");

//output:
//Starting task
//Task Completed
//Callback function executed
```

### Promises
A promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be at some point in the future
- REST requests are a promise

Promises can use the `.then` function to execute certain code only after the promise has been resolved, but code outside the `then` block might still execute before the promise returns.
```js
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Promise resolved");
    // or you can call reject if this promise is failing
    reject("Promise rejected");
  }, 1000);
});

console.log("Starting task");
//use of .then
promise.then((result) => {
  console.log(result);
});
console.log("Task completed");

//console output:
//Starting task
//Task completed
//Promise resolved
```

The same can be achieved through *async/await* syntax. Where an asynchrounous function is defined using the `async` keyword, and can contain `await` statements to wait on promises before continuing in the function. 
- Can only use `await` in an `async` function

```js
async function asyncTask() {
  const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Promise resolved");
      // or you can call reject if this promise is failing
      reject("Promise rejected");
    }, 1000);
  });
  //wait on promise before continuing
  const result = await promise;
  console.log(result);
}

console.log("Starting task");
asyncTask(); //go into async function, but continue executing code after as well
console.log("Task completed");

//console output:
//Starting task
//Task completed
//Promise resolved
```

#### Asynchronous Function Expression
```js
 (async () => {
       //funtion body
      })();
```
- Executes inline but asynchronously
- Useful for frontend development to wrap an endpoint call without needing a separate function
