### Classes
Classes are used to create reusable objects. Classes have properties (fields) and methods (functions). 

```js
class Person {
	constructor(name, age) {
		//can set fields by declaring in constructor
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}
	//can also set them outside constructor
	gender = "male";
	//fields are public by default, use # to make them private
	//can't be accessed by greet
	#private = 42;

	//in functions need to refer to fields with this keyword
	greet() {
		console.log(`Hello, I am ${this.name}. I am ${this.age} and ${this.gender}`);
	}
}
//undefined name and age, gender is male
const p1 = new Person(); 
//name = joe, age = 42, gender is male
const p2 = new Person("Joe", 42);
p1.greet();
p2.greet();
```


### JSON-Like Model
**JavaScript Object Notation**
- Objects in Javascript use key/value pairings
- Can make a new object using JSON
	- If creating objects using standard java method, this is what it is converted into internally
- For Objects in Javascript, quotes around key names are optional
	- Unlike actual JSON, which requires keys to be double quoted
```js
let obj = {
	'key': 'value',
	myNum: 5,
	"new key": "new value"
};
obj.key;
obj.myNum
obj["new key"]
```

### Modules
Used to split code into separate files and written using the `export` keyword. Modules can also have a default export which is a special export that is executed when the module is imported.
##### CommonJS
- Used by NodeJS
```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age}`);
  }

}

class Student {
  constructor(name, grade) {
    this.name = name;
    this.grade = grade;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and my grade is ${this.grade}`);
  }
}

module.exports = {
  Person: Person,
  Stud: Student
};
```

```js
//in another file
//construct 2 variables for each object in exports
const {Person, Stud} = require("/person.js"); 
const person1 = new Person("John Doe", 30);
const student = new Stud("Bill", 'A');
person1.greet();
student.greet();
```

```js
//Can also have exports individually, or "named exports"
exports.obj1 = {};
exports.obj2 = () => {};

//in another file
const {obj1, obj2} = require('module-name');
```

##### ECMAScript Modules
- Used as Javascript language standard
- Can configure Node to use, but lose some functionality


### Methods
- `Object.keys(obj)` - return an array containing all keys of the object
- `Object.values(obj)` - return an array containing all values of the object
- `Object.entries(obj)` - return an array containing all entries of an object, each entry is `[key, value]`
