### Linking
Can use either external files or script tags
```html
<head>
	...
	<script src="path/to/myscript.js"></script>
<head>

<script>
	//Javascript
</script>
```

Use the `<noscript>` tag to display alternate content when Javascript is disabled
```html
<noscript>Javascript required for this app</noscript> 
```
### DOM (Document Object Model)
```html
<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>aa</td>
			<td>ab</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>ba</td>
			<td>bb</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
```
- HTML can be thought of as a tree, with tags having sibling and children
	- This tree has *Nodes* that are part of the tree, this tree is essentially the DOM, with the root being accessed via the keyword `document`
		- These *Nodes* are normally individual HTML elements, but things like attributes, comments, and text are all *nodes* in the DOM tree
		- Not all Nodes are elements, but all Elements are Nodes
	- This `document` can be thought of as referring to the `<html>` tag at the start of the HTML file, with the *head* and *body* as it's children

>In the above example, \<tbody> is a is a direct child of \<table>, and \<tbody> has two children, being the two \<tr> elements. Those two \<tr> elements are siblings. All the \<td> elements are siblings of each other, with a parent \<tr> tag.

#### Traversing the DOM

- Can access specific elements on the tree by using the `document` keyword using their id, class, name, html tag, and more
```js
document.getElementById("id")
document.getElementByClassName("className")
document.getElementsByName("name")
document.getElementsByTagName("tagName")
```

- Can access parts of the DOM tree using a specific element/node
	- To get all siblings need to call the parent node, then get it's children
	- When the query would / could give multiple results (such as `x.childNodes`) it puts the data in a [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList) which can be iterated over with `forEach()` or converted to an array with `Array.from()`
```js
let x = document.getElement...
x.nextSibling
x.previousSibling
x.parentNode
x.parentElement
x.childNodes
x.children
x.firstChild
x.lastChild
```

#### Manipulating the DOM
- Can create new nodes to be put on the document
	- To create, use `document.createElement("div")` where "div" would be replaced by the element to be created
	- Can create text nodes by using `document.createTextNode("text")` where "text" is the text to display. Appending this to an element will make the element show that text
		- [Slightly different](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13122760/is-there-any-major-difference-between-innerhtml-and-using-createtextnode-to-fill) from manipulating the `innerhtml`, but not in a way that is too meaningful
- Appending / removing to the document can be done with a method such as:
```js
Node.appendChild(child) //creates child
Node.append(element) //creates sibling
Node.removeChild(child) //removes 
Node.remove() //removes node
Node.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild)
```
- Can manipulate element attributes as well, these would be things like their style, class, id, and other attributes
	- Can use the catch-all `Element.setAttribute` and `Element.getAttribute` instead of individual attribute accessors/mutators
	- Using `element.InnerHTML` sets the inner HTML content of an element
		- `<button>InnerHTML</button>`
```js
let x = document.getElement...

x.setAttribute("id", "myId");
x.id = "myId";

let xId = x.getAttribute("id")
let xId = x.id;
```

### Events
Can add events to elements for actions to take place
```js
source.addEventListener(eventType, listener, [options]);

//can remove events with the following
source.removeEventListener(eventType, listener);
```
- `eventType` is the kind of event to listen for 
- `listener` is a callback that is executed when the event occurs
- `options` are optional options that can be specified
	- [More info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
- Can prevent the event from executing default behaviors via `Event.preventDefault()`
	- Default behaviors are things that happen automatically, like typing in a text field to have characters appear in the field
- Can prevent propagation of events through to their parents using `Event.stopPropagation()`
	- Example would be a click event registering on a `div`, and also the `body` that is it's parent. If these two have different click events, we do not want the `div` click to also trigger the `body` click

**Kinds of Events**
- **Mouse**
	- click
	- dblclick
	- mousemove
	- mouseleave
	- mouseenter
	- mousewheel
- **Keyboard**
	- keydown
	- keyup
	- Can get the specific key with `Event.key` or `Event.code`
		- If x is pressed:
			- `Event.key` = "x"
			- `Event.code` = "Keyx"
- **Form**
	- reset
	- change
	- submit
- [More](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

#### Special Events
- *load* - added to the `window` object, executed when the page is fully loaded
	- `window.onload = func` 
	- `window.addEventListener("load", func)`
- *DOMContentLoaded* - added to the `document` object when all DOM content is fully loaded
	- Faster than `window.onload` but not everything on the page is loaded, only checks for the DOM tree
	- `document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", func)`
	- `onDOMContentLoaded = func`

### Fetch 
- Use `fetch(/endpoint)` to retrieve information from some API
	- By default makes a GET request
	- Returns a *promise*
	- Any request that receives an HTTP response resolves with a **Response** object (normally called res) containing (among others) the properties:
		- `body`: stream of byte data received
			- To convert to text use `res.text()`
			- To convert to json use `res.json()`
		- `headers`: A **Headers** object
			- Example properties are *Accept*, and *Content-Type*. Just information about the request
		- `status`: HTTP status code
		- `statusText`: Text of the status message
		- `ok`: boolean value to test if request was successful (2XX status)

```js
fetch('/endpoint/for/text').then(res => {
	if (!res.ok) {
		console.error(`Error code ${res.status}: ${res.statusText}`);
	} else {
		return res.text();
	}
}).then(text => {
	console.log('Response: ', text);
}).catch(err => {
	console.error(err);
});

fetch('/endpoint/for/json').then(res => {
	if (!res.ok) {
		console.error(`Error code ${res.status}: ${res.statusText}`);
	} else {
		return res.json();
	}
}).then(obj => {
	console.log('Response: ', obj);
}).catch(err => {
	console.error(err);
});

//To modift FETCH to make a different kind of request (e.g. POST) use the optional second parameter "options"
fetch('/upload', {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		'Accept': 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json'
	},
	body: JSON.stringify(objToPass)
}).then((res) => {
	console.log("whatever needs to be done after upload");
}).catch(err => {
	console.error(err);
})
```
