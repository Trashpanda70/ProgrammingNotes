>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, rather than just in the browser. It is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

To run a nodejs application, can use `node script.js` on the terminal, or just `./script.js`  if the proper shebang is available at the top of the script
- Shebang might be `#!/usr/bin/env node`

### Common Modules
Node.js has some built-in modules that are usable without installing any additional packages, called core modules.
- To import a module use the following syntax:
	- `const name = require('module')`
- Equivalent in python:
	- `import module as name`

#### fs module
Allows for interatcting of the file system and is modeled around standard POSIX functions
- `readfile` - read contents of file. First argument is path to the file, second is encoding (ex 'utf8'), third is a callback function that takes two arguments (error and data read from file)
```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('nodejsShebang.js', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

- `writeFile` - write contents of file. First argument is path to the file, second is data to write, third is a callback that only takes one argument (error)

**These functions are asynchronous**
- Can use the synchronous versions if needed
	- `readFileSync`
	- `writeFileSync`
	- No callback function for sync functions
	- Could lead to performance issues so only do this if necessary

Could also write asynchronous code that looks synchronous using async/await
```js
const fs = require("fs");

async function readMyFile() {
  return fs.promises.readFile("file.txt", "utf8");
}

(async ()=>{
  let data;
  try {
    data = await readMyFile();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Got an Error: ', error);
  }
  console.log("Printing file.txt =", data);
  console.log("A statement after reading file.txt");
})()
//order printed:
//Printing file.txt = Here is content of file.txt
//A statement after reading file.txt
```

#### path module
Provides utilities for working with file and directory paths
```js
const os = require('os');
const path = require("path");

const filePath = "/home/user/file.txt";

console.log(path.basename(filePath)); //file.txt
console.log(path.extname(filePath)); //.txt
console.log(path.dirname(filePath)); // /home/user
console.log(path.join('/home/user', 'projects/script.js')); // /home/user/projects/script.js
console.log(path.join(os.tmpdir(), 'projects/script.js')); // /tmp/projects/script.js
```

#### os module
Provides utilities for interacting with the operating system, can be used to get information about the operating system, current user, and working directory
```js
const os = require("os");

console.log(os.platform()); //OS type ex: linux
console.log(os.userInfo().username); //current user
console.log(os.homedir()); //home directory 
```

### npm
A package manager for Node.js (similar to Maven for Java). Allows installation and managing of JavaScript packages. The npm registry is a collection of open-source packages written in JavaScript. Can search for packages at [https://www.npmjs.com/](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A package is a directory that contains a `package.json` and a collection of javascript files. 
- `package.json` contains information about the package like name, version, and dependencies. To create a package, can use the `npm init` command.
- To install a package, use `npm install packageName`
	- When installed you can see the `package.json` for it. A `^` by the version name indicates the package will be updated to new minor versions, but not new major versions
- To run the package, it might not always be as simple as `node index.js`. Sometimes environment variables are needed, or the application needs to be started a specific way. npm provides a `scripts` field in the `package.json` file, which defines scripts run using the `npm run` command. 
- With the following, the package can be run using the `npm run dev` command instead of `node index.js`

```json
{
  "name": "node-workshop",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Node.js workshop",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1",
    "dev": "node index.js"
  },
  "keywords": ["node", "workshop"],
  "author": "John Doe",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.15"
  }
}
```

### axios
Package form npm registry that makes HTTP requests easy. Below are some quick code snippets for HTTP requests in axios, assuming `const axios = require("axios");`
- GET: `axios.get(URL)`
- DELETE: `axios.delete(URL)`
- PUT: `axios.put(URL, JSON)`
	- update
- POST: `axios.post(URL, JSON)`
	- new 

Can use in 2 ways:
1. .then and .catch syntax
```js
const ax = require("axios");
ax.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/5").then(response => {
    console.log(response.data.title);
}).catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});
```

2. async/await syntax
```js
const ax = require("axios");
(async () => {
    let response;
    try{
        response = await ax.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/5");
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error: ", err);
    }
    console.log(response.data.title);
})()
```

## Express and REST API
Can use *express* `npm install express` to host a web server
- Generally, `index.js` for web servers will look something like the following
- `__dirname` is a constant provided by Node for the working directory of the script
	- If running in a different file than `index.js`, `__dirname` will point to that file's directory (not `index.js`)
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;
//serve static resources such as images
app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/public'));
//use JSON for data transfer
app.use(express.json());
//start listening on port
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server listening on port: ${PORT}`));
```

Can then create HTTP methods using the `app` variable.
- Can use GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Can send data / webpages
- `req` is data sent by the request, `res` is used to send data back
- The callback can be asynchronous, allowing for `await` operations such as accessing a database
```js
//basic endpoint
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send('Hello, World!');
});

//return an HTML page
const html_dir = __dirname + '/path/to/files/'
app.get('/path', (req, res) => {
	res.sendFile(html_dir + 'index.html');
});

//using URL parameters
//EX: endpoint is /student/{name}
//Also sending an HTML response code
//req.params is JSON of all the params assuming express is using JSON
app.get('/param/:name/:name2', async (req, res) => {
    const { name, name2 } = req.params;
    if (name) {
      res.status(200).send(`Name sent: ${name} <br>Name2 sent: ${name2}`);
    } else {
      //this probably wont run because /param will not be found (404)
      res.status(400).send("no name sent");
    }
  });

//read URL queries
//ex: /data?q=query
//req.query is JSON of all queries assuming express is using JSON
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
	res.status(200).send(req.query);
});
```

- To relocate the endpoints to a different file, create a module export and require it inside `index.js` (or whatever file is)
```js
//file with endpoints
module.exports = function (app) {
	...
	//endpoints
	...
}

//index.js
//assuming file is in endpoints folder
require('./endpoints/fileName')(app);
```

- Can also use built in `express.Router` module
	- Better solution
```js
//file with endpoints
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log("middleware executed");
  next();
});

router.get('/point', async (req, res) => {
  console.log('endpoint 2');
  res.status.send("string");
});

router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  res.status.send("default");
});

//index.js
//assuming file is in endpoints folder
const endpoints = require('./endpoints/endpointsFile');
app.use('/', endpoints);

//could specify a path to use by default
//default endpoint in endpoints file points to /end
//point endpoint in endpoints file points to /end/point 
app.use('/end', endpoints);
```

#### Implementing Middleware
Endpoints take a third parameter aside from `req` and `res` called `next` which allows a chain of calls to go through the API

```js
app.get('/', (req, res, next) => {
	//..do stuff
	next(); //next endpoint or function
});
```

When using `app.use(...)` you tell express to "install" the given middleware in the chain
- The parameter to `use` is a function to be called in next in the chain to middleware
- Can write your own `app.use` functions to create your own middleware for all endpoints
	- Useful for authentication, error handling, logging, etc.

```js
app.use((req, res, next) => {
	//do things
	console.log("middleware executed");
	//check for authenitcation, errors, etc.
	next();
});
```
