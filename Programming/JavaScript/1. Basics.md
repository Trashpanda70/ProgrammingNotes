- High level language
- Interpreted language: Code not compiled into machine code but run by another program
- Dynamically Typed: Type checks are done and can change during runtime (unlike Java)
- Weakly (loosely) Typed: Allows implicit conversions between unrelated types (unlike Ruby)

### Variables
3 Types of Variables
- `var` - Function scoped (no matter where they are declared)
	- Value assignment occurs in block it is defined, declaration "hoisted" to function scope
- `let` - Block scoped (normal for languages)
- `const` - Block scoped but cannot be reassigned

**Types**
- String
	- Single and double quote strings supported. Same meaning except for which quote is allowed
		- `"single quote ' is allowed"`
		- `'double quote " is allowed'`
	- Backticks support interpolation
	```js
	let x = "dollar sign"
	let y = `interpolate with ${x}`	```
- Number - floats and ints
- BigInt - larger than int max value 
	- EX: `9007199254740991425n`
- Boolean
- Null - falsy, intentional absence of value
- Undefined - falsy, variable has not been assigned a value
- Object

To type check, use `!==` and `!===` 
```js
true == 1 //false
true === 1 //true

true != 1 //false
true !=== 1 //true

false == 0 //true
false === 0 //false
```

### Arrays
- Arrays are a collection of values surrounded in brackets, separated by commas
- Can mix and match variable types in the array
	- `const stuff = ["me", null, 5, [4, "yo"], true]`
- Get length of array with `.length`

#### Quick Method Docs
- `concat` - Merge arrays, returns new array
- `reverse` - Reverse the array, done in-place (array modified)
- `toReversed` - Reverse the array, returns new array
- `sort` - Sorts the array. Takes optional parameter to allow overriding the function used for sorting, like a comparator
- `includes` - Returns true if value is included in the array
	- Takes optional parameter to determine what index to start searching from

### Functions
Blocks of code that are executed when called. Code for a function surrounded in curly braces, and parenthesis needed when called (even if no parameters are given)

```js
function myFunction() {
	console.log("Hi");
}
```

Functions can also be anonymous, meaning they do not have a name. This uses arrow syntax and there is not really too much advantage to using one over the other (for normal functions). 

```js
const myFunction = () => {
	console.log("Hi");
	return 1;
};

//same as following
const myFunction = function() {
	console.log("Hi");
	return 1;
}

myFunction();
```
### Loops
Normal loops such as for, while, and do..while are similar to other languages.
```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log(i);
}

let x = 1;
while (true) {
	if (x > 5)
		break;
}

let y = 1;
do {
	console.log(i++);
} while (i < 5);
```

Can use `for...of` or `forEach` to loop through elements of something like an array

```js
const nums = [1, 5, 6, 8, 3];

for (const n of nums) {
	console.log(n);
}

nums.forEach((n) => {
	console.log(n);
});
```

##### For..of vs For..in 
- For..of is for *iterables* like Arrays, Strings, Maps, Sets, etc.
	- Normal for-each behavior in Java
- For..in is on *enumerables* like Objects
	- Loop through properties of JSON for example
```js
for (const element of array) {
	//...
}

for (const property in object) {
	//...
}
```

### Quick Notes
- ** is exponentiation: `2 ** 3 = 8`
- Special number `Infinity` (and `-Infinity`)
	- Can achieve with `1/0` or `-1/0`
- `typeof` operator exists to check the type of an Object
