### If Statements
- If statements do not need parenthesis around them
- If statements are ended with an `end` statement (no curly braces)
- An else statement does not need its own end (only the whole if block)
- *Ruby uses `elsif` instead of "else if"*

```rb
if x < 0
	puts "x is negative"
elsif x > 0
	puts "x is positive"
else
	puts "x is 0"
end
```

#### Unless
- Keyword substitution for the "if" in an if statement
- Essentially performs "if not ..."
- For example: 
```rb
unless bool # could be if !bool
	# executes if bool is false
else
	# executes if bool is true
end
```

#### Comparisons
- Can use `==` and `!=`
- Basic comparisons (>, <, <=, >=) are the same
- Can still use `&&`, `||`, and `!`
	- Can also use `and` and `or` words to replace symbols, but not as good style (and might not always work)

#### In-line Logic
- Can use if and unless statements in line to determine whether something executes
- Examples below:
```rb
error = false
puts "no error" unless error

return 1 if i > 0
return -1 # instead of creating an if block for return

return 0 unless a == -1 && b < 0

str = str.upcase unless rand * 10 > 80 or choice != 0

puts "yeah" unless false # always prints
puts "nope" unless true # never prints

puts "yessir" if true # always prints
puts "nosir" if false # never prints
```

### Switch Statements
Note that they are called "case statements" since the word "switch" is not actually present, but they are the same thing.
- No break statements are necessary

Syntax for a switch statement in Ruby:
```rb
# note indentation, lack of break, and end statement
case var
	when val1
		# code
	when val2
		# code
	when val3
		# code
	else # equivalent to default
		# code
end
```

Can also use shorthand syntax
```rb
case var
	when val1 then # simple 1 line of code (EX: puts "text" or x = y)
	when val2 then # simple 1 line of code
	when val3 then # simple 1 line of code
	else # simple 1 line of code
```

## Loops
Loops in Ruby, like if-statements, do not need curly braces
	- Ending is marked with an `end` statement

### While loop
- While loop has generally normal syntax
```rb
i = 4
while i < 10
	i += 1
	puts i
end
```

### Until loop
- Ruby has an "until" loop. Described as a "backwards while loop"
- Essentially: *Loop until the condition is true* 

Examples:
```rb
# Loop until i is 5
i = 0
until i == 5
	i += 1
	puts i
end

until a && b || c # Loops until the expression is true

until false # Will loop forever - as opposed to while true
until true # Will not execute - as opposed to while false

# The following while and until statements are the same
while i == 5
until i != 5

while i < 10
until i >= 10

while bool
until !bool

while a && b
until !a || !b

while !a && !b
until a || b

```

### For loop
- Similar to bash for loops
- Loop variable (like i or var) does not need a type defined since Ruby is dynamically typed

**Inclusive/Exclusive**
- Two dots `..` gives an **inclusive** loop. Meaning that a loop from *x* to *y* will execute with a final value of *y*
- Three dots `...` gives an **exclusive** loop. Meaning that a loop from *x* to *y* will execute with a final value of *y-1*

Loops in languages such as **C** and **Java** are *exclusive*

Syntax:
```rb
# Inclusive: Prints values starting at x and ending at y-1
for var in x..y
	puts var
end

# Exclusive: Prints values starting at x and ending at y
for var in x...y
	puts var
end
```

### Iterators
- An iterator in Ruby is a method that repeatedly invokes a block of code

#### The Loop Method
Can use the loop method to simply loop a block of code for an infinite amount of time
- Curly braces can replace the `do` and `end` keywords
- The three loops below are identical and both valid
	- And all are infinite

```rb
loop do
	print "yo"
end

# Called "loop method" as this is general method syntax (without def obviously)
loop {
	print "yo"
}

loop { print "yo" }
```

#### Break and Next
This can be used to emulate a "do..while" loop using the `break` statement
- Break works the same way as for most programming languages
- Remember about [[#In-line Logic]]
	- Can use `break if ...` or `break unless ...`
	- Can also just use `break` by itself

```rb
# Do-while implementation
loop do
	# some code
	break if # some condition. Or break unless some condition
end

# ex:
i = 0
loop {
	puts i
	i += 1
	break unless i < 5 # same as break if i >= 5
}
```

The `next` keyword is equivalent to *continue* in Java and C
- Works the same way as *continue*
- Can use in-line logic the same way as break
	- i.e. `next if ...` or `next unless ...`
	- As with break, can also just use `next` by itself

The example below uses *next* to only print odd numbers

```rb
for i in 1..10
	next if i % 2 == 0
	puts i
end
```

#### .times iterator
- Just a very compact for loop
	- Can be considered better style

Syntax:
```rb
x.times { puts "hi"} # puts hi x times

# puts hello 10 times
10.times do
	puts "hello"
end
```

#### .upto and .downto methods
- Used to perform operations on a known range of numbers
- A more Ruby-like solution than using a for-loop that stops when a counter hits a specified value
- `.upto` counts upwards
	- works on strings and numbers
- `.downto` counts downwards
	- works on numbers

```rb
10.upto(15) { |num| print num, " "} # prints numbers 10-15 on one line with a space between them

90.downto(70) do |num| puts num end # puts all numbers from 90 down to 70 on a separate line

"A".upto("F") { |letter| puts letter if letter != "E"} # puts all letters between A and F that are not E

65.upto(50) { |num| puts num } # puts nothing since 65 is larger than 50
50.downto(70) { |num| puts num } # puts nothing since 50 is smaller than 70
```
