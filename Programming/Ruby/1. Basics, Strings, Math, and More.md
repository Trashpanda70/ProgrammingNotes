## Basics of Ruby
Ruby is generally used for web/Internet development, text processing, games, and is used in Ruby on Rails (A popular web framework)
- High level language
- Interpreted language: Code not compiled into machine code but run by another program
- Dynamically Typed: Type checks are done and can change during runtime (unlike Java)
- Strongly Typed: Does not allow implicit conversions between unrelated types (unlike JavaScript)
- Object Oriented: Everything is an object in Ruby, even though procedural programming is supported
- [Documentation](https://ruby-doc.org/)
- [Style Guide]([Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/))

#### Comments
- Use `#` for a single line comment
- Use `=begin` and `=end` for multi-line comments, each of which is on a separate line

```rb
# Single line comment

=begin
multi
line
comment
=end
```

### Basic Console I/O
**Console Output**
- `puts` - Prints the string or variable with a newline character at the end
- `print` - Prints the string or variable without a newline character at the end
	- Can take more than one parameter
	- ex: `print num` or `print num, " "` (for loops perhaps) or `print name, ": ", grade`
- `p` - Prints strings with quotation marks around them, other variables normally, includes a newline character 
	- Used for debugging

**String Interpolation**: Used to print other variables (like integers) within a string
- Similar to what is done in bash
- Use  `#{var_name}` inside the string

```rb
age = 21
puts "At time of writing I am #{age} years old"
```

**Console Input**
- Use `gets` for simple console input
- Ruby adds a new line after each bit of input automatically, to negate this use `gets.chomp`
	- The `chomp` method removes the new line

```rb
print "Enter age: "
age = gets.chomp
puts "You are #{age} years old"
```
### Variables
- Ruby variables do not need to have their type explicitly defined
	- Dynamically typed: Checks type during runtime rather than compile time
	- Strongly typed: Types can change during runtime
- NOTE: Ruby ***Does Not*** have post/pre increment/decrement (`++` and `--`)

#### Naming conventions
- Local variables start with a lowercase letter 
	- should be in snake_case (all lowercase with underscores between words)
	- Could make variables start with $ or@
		- Bad style
	- Do not separate numbers from words with an underscore
		- Good: my_num1
		- Bad: my_num_1

Variables starting with a capital letter are constant
- Good for file level (not in a class) variables
- This is the reason why class names are forced to start with a capital
- Convention states that variables that are not a class/module should be in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

```rb
num = 25
my_bool = true
my_string = "words"
num = "twenty-five" #allowed
num = 25 

MyConst
```

### Math
Generic 4 Math operations
- Modulo is still `%`
- Exponentiation is `**`
	- 4 ** 2 = 16
- Supports `+=` and similar operations
- Use `Math.sqrt(value)` for square root
- Again, **does not** support `++` and `--`

### Strings
Strings in Ruby can be single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`. There is no real performance impact between the two, but there are differences.
- Single quotes do not allow escape sequences (except the singe quote character itself)
- Single quotes do not allow **String Interpolation**
	- String Interpolation is how variables can be inserted into strings (cannot just use `+` like Java and some other languages)
	- Syntax for Interpolation is `"the string #{variable} continue the string"`
	- Interpolation will insert the value of the variable as if it were being printed (this includes things like arrays, not just integers)
- As a general rule, use single quotes if you need to print an exact string that double quotes might unintentionally interpolate or mark an escape sequence and use double quotes for everything else
	- Could also use double quotes and escape the `#` or `\` 
- For comparing strings use `==`
	- Can also compare strings using comparison operators to check for alphabetical order
- Can concatenate strings using the concatenation operator
	- `str1 << " " << str2 == str1 str2`
	- This operator can be used with assignment `<<=`
	- Can also be used for [[3. Arrays and Hashes#Array Methods|arrays]]
	- Operator works with variables

```rb
# Single quotes vs Double Quotes
puts 'Here is a\nNew line!' 
# Here is a\nNew line!

puts "Here is a\nNew line!" 
# Here is a 
# New line!

#Notice the syntax highlighting below
var = 5
puts '#{var} is a cool number'
# #{var} is a cool number
puts "#{var} is a cool number"
# 5 is a cool number

# String comparison
str1 = "yeah"
str2 = "ok"
if str1 < str2
	puts "#{str1} comes first!"
elsif str1 > str2
	puts  "#{str2} comes first!"
else
	puts "They are the same!"
end

# Concatenation
str1 = "ok"
str2 = "buddy"
puts str1 << " " << str2 # puts "ok buddy"
puts str1 << str1 << " wow " << str2 << "!" # puts okok wow buddy!

str1 <<= " wow " 
puts str1 << str2 # puts "ok wow buddy"
```

Strings have many methods to work with in Ruby by default
- `length` - length of the string
- `reverse` - reverse the string
- `upcase` - makes the string uppercase
- `downcase` - makes the string lowercase
- `capitalize` - makes the first letter capital and the rest lowercase
- `include?` - checks to see if the string contains the given substring
	- Syntax: *string_name*.include? "*substring to search for*"
	- ex: `my_string.include? "bruh"`
- `gsub(/s1/, "s2")` - replaces every instance of first string with second string
	- Stands for Global Substitution
	- s1 is between forward slashes, `/` because it is not a string but a `Pattern` (Regex Pattern)
	- s2 is in quotation marks
- `concat(str)` - concatenates another string onto the string (other string specified by str)
- `split(delimiter)` - splits the string using the specified delimiter string. Returns an Array of split substrings
	- substring used can be more than a single character for delimiter
	- if two of the delimiters are next to each other (nothing in-between) then Ruby wil put a blank string for that spot in the array
- `each_char` - loops over each character in a string and performs the specified operation on it. Like [[3. Arrays and Hashes#Iterating with Arrays using .each|.each]] for characters in a string
```rb
my_string = "yo can i split"
my_arr = my_string.split(" ")
# my_arr is ["yo" , "can" , "i" , "split"]

str = "canyoIyosplityoyopls"
arr = str.split("yo")
# arr is ["can", "I", "split", "", "pls"]
```
