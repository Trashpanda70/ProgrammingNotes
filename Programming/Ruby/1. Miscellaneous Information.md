#### Methods that execute and assign
Using an exclamation point will automatically assign the method return to the value of the String. (More on this in notes about methods)
- If a method takes parameters, the exclamation point comes before parenthesis
- These methods are called "destructive" methods

```rb
name = "matt"
# two below statements are the same
name = name.upcase
name.upcase!

#ex with parenthesis
lisp_speech.gsub!(/s/, "th")
```
---
#### Curly Braces vs do..end
Generally: do..end can be replaced by curly braces 

Below, the following two would do the same
```rb
keyword {
	# some code
}

keyword do 
	# some code
end
```
- This is used (and introduced) in the [[3. If-Statements and Loops#The Loop Method|Loop Method Notes]] 
- This does not apply unless both the `do` and `end` keywords are present
	- Does not work on if-statements, while loops, etc.

---
#### Nil
`nil` is the "empty object" in Ruby
- Equivalent to `null` in Java

When printed, `nil` will print as the empty string
- Cannot do `nil.method` as it is equivalent to doing `null.method` in Java

**Dereferencing Nil**
Seeing the message:  `undefined method 'method_name' for nil:NilClass` is essentially Ruby's version of a NullPointerException
- Means that you tried to do `nil.method_name` 

`nil` evaluates to false (similar to how NULL is false in C). So can do some neat things

```rb
# pretend theres some array arr that may or may not be nil
if arr
	#do stuff
end

return nil unless arr #return nil unless arr is not nil (return nil if arr is nil)
```

---
#### Printing Strings and Arrays Uniquely
- Since an index of -1 references the last element of an array, can do some cool tricks for printing them 
	- Under the hood, strings are character arrays. Because of this, can use array notation with Strings
	- For doing this remember: `..` is inclusive, `...` is exclusive (only for last index)

Examples:
```rb
str = "Ruby is Fun!"
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

puts str[0] # puts "R"
puts str[-1] # puts "!
puts str[0..3] # puts "Ruby" - Remember 2 dots is inclusive
puts str[5...7] # puts "is" - Remember 3 dots is exclusive
puts str[5..-1] # puts "is Fun!" - Since -1 is last element and .. is inclusive

puts arr[1..-1] # puts [2, 3, 4, 5] (brackets and commas included)
puts arr[1...-1] # puts [2, 3, 4] (Since its exlusive)
puts arr[2..-2] # puts [3, 4]
puts arr[3..-3] # puts [] (If range is flipped nothing gets printed)
```

Obviously works for assignment too, not just printing

---
#### Converting Types
Ruby types are dynamic, but still cannot do certain things
- Cannot add a string to an integer
- Cannot concatenate an integer to a string

Can use certain methods to convert types
- `to_i` - Converts to an integer
	- EX: "5".to_i
- `to_f` - Converts to a float (no "double" type)
	- EX: "5.6".to_f
- `to_s` - Converts to a string
	- EX: 104.to_s

**Speaking of Float:**
- Just like Java, if one number is a float in a math expression, the whole thing gets converted to a float.
	- `puts 5/2` - puts 2
	- `puts 5/2.0` - puts 2.5
	- `puts 5/2.to_f` - Also works, puts 2.5

---
#### Truthy vs. Falsy
Truthy and Falsy are ways to describe what certain values evaluate to in a boolean expression
- If it is "truthy" then it will evaluate to true
- If it is "falsy" then it will evaluate to false

>Using C as an example:
>- 1 is truthy 
>- 0 is falsy, NULL is falsy

**In Ruby**
- `false` is falsy
- `nil` is falsy
- Everything else (including 0) is truthy
	- This is why you can do `if object` to check if an object is non-nil

---
#### Conditional Assignment
Can use the conditional assignment operator `||=` to assign a value to a variable only if it is nil
- If the variable is not nil, the assignment will not take place
- Can use it for first assignment when declaring a variable, but no need (just use default assignment)
```rb
favorite_language = nil

favorite_language ||= "Java" # value is now Java
favorite_language ||= "C" # value is still Java
favorite_language = "Ruby" # value is now Ruby

favorite_language = nil # value cleared to be nil
favorite_language ||= "English" # value is now English
```
---
#### Determining Class with .is_a?
- Can use the `.is_a?` method to determine what class an object is
	- Syntax: `obj.is_a? ClassName`
	- Notice there is no parenthesis
	- Returns a boolean

Examples
```rb
1.is_a? Integer # true
1.is_a? String # false

x=5.to_s
x.is_a? String # true
```

- On another note can also determine class using the `.class` method
```rb
1.class # Integer
"yo".class # String
```

---
#### System Calls and CMD Commands
- Similar to `os.system` in Python and `exec*` in C, Ruby can run commands in terminal in multiple ways
- All commands run in the directory of the script

**System**
- Use `System( ... )` to run a command in the terminal
- Return is a boolean `true` if execution was successful, `false` if not

**Backticks**
- Use backticks to run a command similar to `System()` but the return will be the output of the command as a string

```rb
x = System("ls") # will print the result of ls to the console
p x # true

x = `ls` # still prints results of ls to the console
p x # prints results of ls again
p "x is string" if x.is_a? String # prints "x is string"
p "x is integer" if x.is_a? Integer # does not print
```

---
#### Setter Methods
A method can become a "setter method" by appending an equals to the end of it.
- Mostly used for setting class variables (without using writers or accessors, or if needing to do error checking)
- Can then use the method with a space between the method call and what the assignment is, as if assigning a variable

Example:
```rb
class Set
	attr_reader :id
	initialize(id)
		@id = id
	end
	# setter - what is generated with attr_writer
	def id=(id)
		@id = id
	end
	# more useful setter
	def id_second=(id)
		@id = id if id.is_a? Integer
	end
end

my_set = Set.new(0)
puts my_set.id # puts 0

my_set.id = 5
puts my_set.id # puts 5

my_set.id= 3
puts my_set.id # puts 3

my_set.id_second = 10
puts my_set.id # puts 10

my_set.id_second = "yo" # because we check if it is an Integer in id_second
puts my_set.id # puts 10
```
