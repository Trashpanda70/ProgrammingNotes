## Arrays
Array initialization in Ruby is just like a normal variable but with brackets and comma separated values
- ex: `my_array = [1, 2, 3, 4]`

Can have an array of any data type (even other arrays or objects, as is usual for programming languages)
- However, since a single array can have multiple different data types in it
	- ex: `arr = [4, "str", "", 8.33, false, [5, 7, "yeah"], 7]`
	- Can mix and match any data type, even other arrays

For 2D arrays indexing is `arr_name[row][col]` as usual
- Can index into a 2D array if it is mixed with other data types
```rb
arr = [4, "str", "", 8.33, false, [5, 7, "yeah"], 7]

arr[0] == 4
arr[2] == ""
arr[5] == [5, 7, "yeah"]
arr[5][2] == "yeah"
```

- Printing an array results in each value being comma separated and brackets `[]` around the whole array

### Iterating with Arrays using .each
Used to index through each element of the expression
- Like a Java for-each loop
- Can technically be done with any Object with multiple elements
	- ex: Arrays, hashmaps, custom data structures(?)

Syntax:
```rb
object.each { |item|
	# some code
}

# Below is equivalent

object.each do |item|
	# some code
end
```
- *item* is just a random variable name (could be anything)
	- It is how the current element in the array (or whatever object) can be referenced
	- Like the variable name of a for-each loop
- Java equivalent is below for reference

```java
for (type item : object) {
	//some code
}
```

This type of loop could be one line
- `array.each { |i| puts i }`
- Java equivalent: `for (type i : array) { System.out.println(i); }`

Can traverse through the elements in reverse order by using `reverse_each { |i| puts i }`



#### Iterating through 2D arrays
- Similar to using a nested for-each loop in Java
- Can also do this with a for loop if the size of the array is known
```rb
s = [["ham", "swiss"], ["turkey", "cheddar"], ["peanut butter", "jelly"]]

# to print each array on a line, without the commas or brackets
s.each { |a| 
	a.each { |x| 
		print "#{x}"
	}
	puts "" # print just a new line
}
```

### Indexing
Ruby array indexing works like most languages (start at 0) but with one addition: *negative indexing*

Can use negative indices to index *backwards* through the array
- An index of -1 is the last element
- An index of -2 is the second to last element
- And so on

NOTE: Still cannot index off the end of an array
- If an array has 3 elements (last element at index 2). Trying to get the element at index 3 will provide `nil`
- It will not crash the program (unless it returning `nil` does something in the future)
- This applies for all indeces outside the range (ex length 2 and try to access index 7)

Can also assign variables when out of bounds in the array
- Will fill any gaps with `nil`

Examples:
```rb
my_array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

my_array[0] == 1
my_array[4] == 9
my_array[-1] == 11
my_array[-3] == 7

my_array[0] == my_array[-6] # -1 * size will reference first element

arr = [4, 5, 6, 7]
arr[6] = 10
puts arr # [4, 5, 6, 7, nil, nil, 10]
```

**Neat Trick**
```rb
# Can turn this code
gender = 1  
if gender == 0  
  life_expectancy = 79  
elsif gender == 1  
  life_expectancy = 80  
end  
print life_expectancy #=> 80

# into this
gender = 1  
life_expectancy = [79,80][gender] # gender is 1, so [79,80][1] #=> 1  
print life_expectancy #=> 80
```

### Array Methods
- `at(idx)` - Another way of accessing array elements. Returns the element at index `idx`
- `reverse / reverse!` - Reverse the contents of the Array
- `sort` - Covered [[5. Methods, Blocks, and Sorting#Using the Sort method|here]]
- `empty?` - Returns true if the array is empty, false otherwise
- `clear` - Removes all elements from the array
- `insert(idx, value)` - Inserts the given value into the given index. Does not override, all other elements will be shifted.
- `include?(obj)` - Returns true if the given object is in the array (checked using `==`) 
- `length` - Returns the length of the array. 
	- Has `size` as an alias
- `push(obj, ...)` - Pushes the given object(s) onto the end of an array. Can chain multiple together.
	- Can use the push operator `<<` to achieve the same effect
		- `arr.push(5, 7) == arr << 5 << 7`
		- Called the concatenation operator (also known as "the shovel")
	- Aliased as `append`
- `pop` - Removes the last element from the array and returns it 
	- Can specify an optional parameter (`push(n)`) that will pop *n* elements from the array and return them as an array
- `collect` - Covered [[7. Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas#Applying a Code Block with Collect|here]]
- `first(num)` - Returns the first element of the array if used with no parameter, or the first n elements of the array if given an integer parameter
- `compact / compact!` - Removes nil elements from an array
- `uniq / uniq!` - Removes duplicate elements from an array

#### Deleteing From an Array
There are multiple ways to delete from an array, however the two listed here are the most basic

**delete and delete_at**
- The `delete(obj)` method is used to remove all occurences of the specified object from the array. Returns the deleted item or `nil` if it was not found
	- Can also provide a block of code (`delete(obj) {block}`) that will act as the default value for if a value was not found rather than returning `nil`
- The `delete_at(idx)` method deletes the value at the specified index and returns it (or `nil` if it was not found)
	- Cannot do the code block trick with this method to change the `nil` return

```rb
arr = [1, 4, 4, 5, "s1", 7, "s2"]

arr.delete(1) # returns 1 and removes it from arr
arr.delete(-8) # returns nil and the array is unchanged
arr.delete(10) {"not found"} # returns "not found" and the array is unchanged
arr.delete(4) # returns 4 and removes both occurences of 4 from the array

arr.delete_at(2) # returns 4 and removes the second 4 from the array
arr.delete_at(-1) # returns "s2" and removes it from the array
arr.delete_at(15) # returns nil and the array in unchanged
```

**Conditional Removal**
- The `delete_if` method takes a block and will delete the element from the array if it matches the given condition
- The `keep_if` method will do the opposite of delete_if, only keeping elements that match the given condition

```rb
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr.delete_if {|x| x < 4} # [4, 5, 6]
arr.keep_if {|x| x < 4} # [1, 2, 3]
```

#### Array Math
Can do math on arrays to add or delete elements in bulk
- These functions are technically implemented as methods, but syntactically do not appear that way
- Since these are functions, they return a value (can assign to a variable or print)
- This also means the contents of the original arrays are preserved 
	- The same way variable values are preserved

**Four functions**
1. To add elements to an array use the addition operator `+`
	- Adds the added elements to the end of the first array, even if there are repeats
2. To subtract elements from an array use the subtraction operator `-`
	- Subtracts elements from the first array that are in the second array. If no elements are shared between arrays nothing happens
	- Same thing can be done with the `.difference` method
		- Takes an array (or multiple arrays) as an argument
		- x - y = x.difference(y)
		- x - y - z = x.difference(y, z)
3. To get the intersection of two arrays (elements they have in common) use `&`
	- Returns an array with values from both arrays being compared
	- Order is preserved from first array
	- Same as using the `.insersection` method
		- Similar semantics to `-` and the `difference` method
		- x & y = x.intersection(y)
		- x & y & z = x.intersection(y, z)
4. To perform a union of two arrays use `|`
	- Appends elements of second array to first array *ignoring duplicates*
	- Preserves order of both arrays
	- Same as using the `.union` method
		- Similar semantics to `-` and the `difference` method
		- x | y = x.union(y)
		- x | y | z = x.union(y, z)

```rb
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [3, 4, 5, 6]
z = [69, 70]

puts x - y # puts [1, 2]
puts x - z # puts [1, 2, 3, 4]

puts x + y # puts [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 5, 6]
puts z + y # puts [69, 70, 3, 4, 5, 6]

puts x & y # puts [3, 4]
puts x & z # puts []

puts x | y # puts [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
puts z | x # puts [69, 70, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

For all these functions, multiple arrays can be compounded 
- `arr1 + arr2 - arr3`
- `(arr1 + arr2) & arr3 & arr4`

## Hashes
A collection of key-value pairs
- Like a Java map or Python dictionary
- Any Ruby object can be used for a key or value (Everything in Ruby is an object)
- Hashes can mix and match data types for both keys and values
	- Like how array values can be mixed data types

### Initialization
```rb
name = {
	key1 => value1,
	key2 => value2,
	key3 => value3,
	keyX => valueX
}

name[key1] == value1
name[keyX] == valueX
# If the keys are integers, then syntax is the same as an array
```
- Note that the curly braces `{}` are ***not*** replaceable with do..end

Can also declare a hash using `Hash.new` 
- Same as declaring an empty hash
```rb
my_hash = Hash.new
my_hash = {}
```

#### Default Value
Can give a hash declared with `Hash.new` a *default value*
- Trying to access the value of a key that does not exist in a hash will return the default value
- If not specified, the default value is `nil`

Syntax for giving a default value: `hash_name = Hash.new(default value)`
- Generally will be a String (or 0) but can be anything

### Adding to a Hash
Can declare a new hash key-value pair individually if not done in initialization syntax
- Same syntax as referencing a hash, just declare a new one and set it equal to something
```rb
hash = Hash.new
# add new values to hash one at a time
hash[1] = "one"
hash["pet"] = "cat"
hash["true"] = true
```

Remember to access a hash value just use `hash_name[key]`

### Iterating Through a Hash
Can use [[#Iterating with Arrays using each|.each]] to iterate through a hash like normal
- Will print each key-value pair between brackets
- Can also iterate through keys and values *at the same time*
	- Specifying a second variable between the pipes `| |` will automatically loop with the keys as well
	- The same amount of iterations are performed, it just gives access to each value as well

```rb
#Using the following hash
hash = {
	"one" => 1,
	"two" => 2,
	"pet" => "dog",
	true => "true!"
}

# normal iteration with .each
hash.each { |k| puts "#{k}" }
# output:
["one", 1]
["two", 2]
["pet", "dog"]
[true, "true!"]

# iterating with both the key and the value using .each
hash.each { |k, v| puts "#{k} maps to #{v}" }
# output
one maps to 1
two maps to 2
pet maps to dog
true maps to true!
```
If only the keys or values are needed, loop through with both and only use the variable needed

**OR**

Can use the `.each_key` or `.each_value` methods
- Work the same as `.each` but only iterate through the key or value
- Only need to specify one variable between pipes (for the key or value)

```rb
my_hash = {
	"one" => 1
	"two" => 2
	"three" => 3
	"four" => 4
}

my_hash.each_key { |k| puts k} # prints out each key

my_hash.each_value { |v|
	puts v * 2 if v % 2 == 0
} # prints out 2 times each even value
```
