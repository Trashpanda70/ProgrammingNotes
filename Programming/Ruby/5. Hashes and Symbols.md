## Hashes
Hashes are **collections** of key-value pairs, where a unique key is associated with some value. For example:
```rb
breakfast = {
	"bacon" => "tasty",
	"eggs" => "healthy",
	"OJ" => "Juicy"
}
```
- Keys must be unique, values can repeat

Can also do `new_hash = Hash.new` to create a new hash object
- Then add hashes with `new_hash[key] = value`

Can iterate over hashes the same way as an array, by using **.each**
- Both the key and value need variables between the pipes even if only 1 is used
```rb
breakfast.each { |food, desc| 
	puts breakfast[food]
}
# Can replace { with do and } with end. Remember that {} = do..end for this
```

- Trying to access a hash that does not exit will return `nil`
- Unless a default value is specified 
	- `my_hash = Hash.new("default value")`

Above is all review of the [[3. Arrays and Hashes#Hashes|Hashes]] Notes

## Symbols
The best keys to use in Hashes.
- Can also be used to [[#Checking Compatability with response_to|reference method names]] 

Symbols are *immutable*
- They cannot be changed once they're created
- Only one copy of a symbol exists at a given time in memory
- These reasons are why they make good hash keys
	- Also means they are faster than strings as hash keys

### Syntax
The Syntax for Symbols is a colon with the name next to it
- `:symbol_name`
	- Naming convention just like local variables
	- Cannot use spaces in the name
	- Names must start with a lowercase letter or underscore, then can have lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers in the name like normal variables

Note: Symbols do not have values like variables, as they are just that, *symbols*
- This is why they are used as hash keys
```rb
# Cannot do this
:symbol_two = 2

# Can do this
my_hash {
	:symbol_two => 2
}
```

### Unique Behavior
Symbols are not strings, but are more like variables that are used for name only
- `"string" != :string`

Also, **there can only be one copy of any particular symbol at any given time**
- This is why they make good keys for hashes, as they cannot be duplicated

#### object_id method
The `object_id` method can be used to get an object's unique ID
- This is how Ruby knows whether two objects are the exact same or not
- object_id *should not be overridden* as it could cause problems
- The return of the `object_id` method will be different for each object
	- Even objects with the same fields will be given a different object id
	- The return of `object_id` is determined by the area in memory an object resides, so setting one object equal to another will result in them having the same object id
- **A symbol with the same name will always have the same object id** (during runtime)
	- This id might change between executions, but never during the lifetime of the object

```rb
# different object id
a = "string".object_id
b = "string".object_id
a == b # false

# make one object reference have the same object id as another
name = "Joe"
name2 = "joe"
name.object_id == name2.object_id # false, due to capitalization
name2 = name # name2 is now "Joe"
name.object_id == name2.object_id #true

# example with symbols
x = :symbol.object_id
y = :symbol.object_id
x == y # true
```

### Converting Between Strings and Symbols
Symbols can be converted to strings and vice versa
- Can convert an array of strings (or just one string) to a symbol before using it as a hash key
- To convert a symbol to string use the `to_s` method (like converting an integer to a string)
- To convert a string to a symbol use the `to_sym` method
	- Cannot convert an integer to a symbol because a symbol must start with a letter (or underscore)
	- Can also use the `.intern` method for the same thing

```rb
# Symbol to String
:my_symbol.to_s # -> "my_symbol"

# String to Symbol
"key_time".to_sym # -> :key_time
"key_time".intern # -> :key_time
```

#### Newer Syntax
Ruby 1.9 changed the syntax of using symbols in hashes
- The old syntax, called "rocket syntax" (=> looks like a rocket) still works, and is used for strings and other non-symbolic values

**Changes:**
1. The semicolon goes at the end of the symbol, not the beginning
2. The rocket is not needed anymore

>Notice this syntax is essentially a JSON file

```rb
old_hash = {
	:one => 1,
	:two => 2,
	:three => 3
}

new_hash = {
	one: 1,
	two: 2,
	three: 3
}
```

### Selecting Values From a Hash using .select
Can use the `.select` method to select certain values from a hash that meet the selected criteria
- Only parameter is a code block (make sure to specify key and value) for filtering (selecting)
	- Syntax for taking a code block as a parameter: `method(params) {code_block}`
	- In this case there are no other parameters, so it's just `select {coce_block}`
- Return value is a *hash* of only the selected values
- Original hash is not modified

```rb
# examples of using select
grades = {
	bob: 94,
	alice: 97,
	jack: 89,
	jill: 88
}

grades.select {|k,v| v > 90} # returns {:bob => 94, :alice => 97}
grades.select {|name, grade| grade == 100} # returns an empty hash (not nil)
grades.select {|k, v| k == :alice} # returns {:alice => 97} - inefficient way to getting a hash with a specific key

```

### Checking Compatability with .response_to? 
Can use the `.respond_to?(method)` method to check if an object can receive (has access to, use, whatever terminology) that method.
- Returns true if it can (so you can call obj.method)
- Returns false if it cannot (method not applicable for that object)
- Calling `nil.respond_to?(method)` will return false for every method (notably it will not cause an error)
- Putting a method that does not exist will return false

Can use symbols (better) or strings to represent the methods
```rb
[1, 2, 3].respond_to?(:push) # true
[1, 2, 3].respond_to?(:to_sym) # false

2.respond_to?(:next) # true (next returns integer after, so in this case 3)
2.respond_to("next") # true

nil.respond_to?(:chomp) # false
nil.respond_to?("nothing") # false

"goat".respond_to(:chomppppo) # false
"gordo".respond_to?(:chomp) # true
```

### Passing a Method as a Parameter Using a Symbol
Methods can also be passed as Parameters and called in whatever function they are passed into
- When calling a method, to pass a method as a parameter use `method(:method_name)` as the argument
- Be sure that in the method (the one taking the parameter and using `.call`) that the `.call` call has the proper parameters
- If the method was wrapped somewhere else (in a [[7. Classes, Objects, and Modules|Class or Module]]) then the syntax would be `somewhere_else.method(:method_name)`

Example
```rb
# methods to call within another method
def add(x, y)
	return x + y
end

module AddModule
	def addM(x, y)
		return x + y
	end
end
include AddModule

class AddClass
	def addC(x, y)
		return x + y
	end
end

# method that calls a method passed to it
def call_add(m, num1, num2)
	puts m.call(num1, num2)
end

# demonstrations
call_add(method(:add), 5, 10) #Standalone method: puts 15
call_add(AddModule.method(:addM), 4, 5) #Wrapped in Module: puts 9
x = AddClass.new
call_add(x.method(:addC), 1, 5) # Wrapped in Class: puts 6
# notice how calling a method from a class needs to be from an instance of that class

```
