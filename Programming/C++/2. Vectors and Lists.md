### Arrays
Arrays still work the same way they did in C
- Create with `type name[size] = {thing1, thing2, ..., thingSize};`
	- Can just do `type name[size];`
- To get the size you need to use `sizeof` and divide by the size of the data type
- Arrays cannot be initialized to the size of a variable, but elements in the array can be set to variables on initialization
- **Can traverse Arrays using a for-each loop**
	- Same syntax as Java: `for (type name : array)`


### Vectors
Vectors are essentially dynamically resizing arrays.
- Include with `#include <vector>`
- Define with `vector<type> name;`
- Element access works like an array (using square brackets)
	- Can also use the `at(n)` function (get element at index n)
- Elements in the vector are stored in continuous storage locations in the same order as in the vector
	- Allows for pointer offsets like arrays
- Can intitialize with default values
	- `vector<int> foo (3, 100);` - 3 int values of 100
	- `vector<int> bar (foo);` - A copy of foo
- Vectors are in the `std` namespace
	- Unless there is a `using` statement, need to reference with `std::vector`
	- Note that this does not apply to vector methods

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
int main() {
	std::vector<int> myvector;
	myvector.push_back(5);
	std::cout << myvector.size();
}
```

#### Iterators
Can construct iterators for vectors that start from various places
- `begin()` - an iterator from the start of the vector
- `end()` - an iterator to the element past the end of the sequence.
	- Use as a check if using the begin iterator (like a loop condition check)
- `rbegin()` - a reverse iterator starting at the end, iterates through the vector backwards
- `rend()` - a reverse iterator to the element past the begining of the sequence
	- Like `end()` but for reverse iteration
- Add a c to the start of any iterator above to make it a `const iterator`
	- Essentially make it so that the element the iterator points to cannot be modified
	- Always prefer const iterators unless a non-const iterator is required (or a method requires a non-const iterator as a parameter)

An example of using iterators to loop through a vector
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
int main () {
  vector<int> myvector;
  for (int i=1; i<=5; i++)
	  myvector.push_back(i);
  //vector now has elements of 1-5

  std::cout << "myvector contains: ";
  //loop through using a vector
  for (vector<int>::iterator it = myvector.begin() ; it != myvector.end(); it++)
    std::cout << ' ' << *it;
  
  std::cout << '\n';
  return 0;
} 
//prints output "myvector constains: 1 2 3 4 5" 
```

#### Methods
- `size()` - return the size of the vector
- `empty()` - test whether the vector is empty
- `front()/back()` - access first or last element
- `data()` - return a pointer to the first element in the vector
	- `int* p = myvector.data()` if the vector holds ints
- `push_back(e)/pop_back()` - push and pop methods to treat the vector like a stack (add/remove from end)
- `insert(idx, e)` - insert element e at index idx. Will shift the list to make room for the new element
- `erase(it)/erase(it, it2)` - erases a single element or range of elements from the vector. Needs to be passed in as a vector
	- `erase(v.begin())` - erase the first element
	- `erase(v.begin()+5)` - erase the 6th element
	- `erase(v.begin+2, v.begin+7)` - Erase from element 3 (index 2) to element 8 (index 7)
- `swap(v)` - Swaps the contents of the vector with the provided vector. The sizes may differ.
