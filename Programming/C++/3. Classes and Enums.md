### Classes
Classes are usually declared in header files. All class members are private by default, but can use labels to change that.
- `public:` makes all members following it public until `private:` or `protected:` is found
- Make sure the constructor is public

**Functions**
- Function implementations normally happen in .cpp files rather than .h files (but not required to follow)
- Define function object parameters (like string or custom objects) using [[C++/1. Basics#References|references]] and *const* references if they are not going to be modified
- **Virtual Functions**
	- Functions should be marked as virtual if they will be overriden in derived (child) classes. Virtual is only needed for the declaration, not the definition (if they are separate). To illustrate why virtual is needed look [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2391679).
- **Const Functions**
	- A function declared `const` does not have permission to modift class data members. Essentially, these functions would either get data or print data, but never modify it.
	- Put `const` after the function parameters
		- `returnType name(params) const {}`
- **Destructor**
	- In addition to the constructor, C++ has a destructor which is called when an object goes out of scope or is deleted.
		- Declared/referenced with a ~ before the name
		- `~ClassName();`
	- If the class is going to be derived from (i.e. become a superclass) then the destructor needs to be `virtual` or else the derived class' (child class') destructor will not be called if the object is destroyed through a reference as a base class (superclass).
		- This is kind of explained in the link above under the virtual functions section.
	- The destructor is used to free allocated heap memory or clean up resources. If not specified then the default destructor is used.
	- Can imlicitly call the destructor with `objectName.~ClassName();`
	- A class cannot have more than one constructor, and it does not take parameters

**dog.h**
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using std::string;
class Dog {
	string name;
	int weight;
	
public:
	Dog(); //constructor
	
	Dog(const string& dogName, int dogWeight) { 
		name = dogName; 
		weight = dogWeight;
		std::cout << "Dog made\n";
	} //Can (maybe should) be in cpp file

	virtual void print() const;
	void setName(const string& dogName);
	void setWeight(int dogWeight);
	virtual void bark(int times=1) const;
	
	//destructor, only used for demonstration purposes as there is no heap memory used in this class
	virtual ~Dog();
}; //note semicolon after class definition
```

**dog.cpp**
```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include "dog.h"
using namespace std;
//implement functions not implemented in header
Dog::Dog() {
	cout << "Dog made\n";
}

//no need for virtual keyword in definition
void Dog::print() const {
	//the Dog:: in the header is essentially like the function is in the Dog class, so access to private fields is allowed 
	cout << "Dog Name: " << name << " and weighs " << weight << endl; 
}

void Dog::setName(const string& dogName) {
	name = dogName;
}

void Dog::setWeight(int dogWeight) {
	weight = dogWeight;
}

void Dog::bark(int times) const {
	for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
		cout << "woof!\n"; 
	}
}

Dog::~Dog() {
	cout << "Dog destroyed\n";
}

int main() {
	Dog myDog; //"Dog made"
	myDog.setName("Logan");
	myDog.setWeight(50);
	myDog.print(); //"Dog Name: Logan and weighs: 50"
	return 0;
} //Destructor implicity called, prints "Dog destroyed"
```

### Inheritance
Child classes inherit everything public and protected from their parent class. They also inherit private members/methods but may not directly access them without a public or protected intermediary method
- Make sure functions that will be overriden are marked as `virtual` in the superclass
- They do not need to be `virtual` in the subclass unless that class will also be inherited from

**Syntax**
- `class ChildClassName : public ParentClassName`

**louddog.h**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
//#include "dog.h" not needed idk why?
//maybe use #ifdef or something figure out later
class LoudDog : public Dog {
	int decibels;
	
public:
	LoudDog();
	void print() const;
	void bark(int times=5) const;
	void setDecibels(int dec) {
		decibels = dec;
	}
	~LoudDog();
};
```

Can modify the `dog.cpp` file from above to make it the following:

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include "dog.h"
#include "louddog.h"
using namespace std;
//implement functions not implemented in header for Dog class
Dog::Dog() {
	cout << "Dog made\n";
}

//no need for virtual keyword in definition
void Dog::print() const {
	//the Dog:: in the header is essentially like the function is in the Dog class, so access to private fields is allowed 
	cout << "Dog Name: " << name << " and weighs " << weight << endl; 
}

void Dog::setName(const string& dogName) {
	name = dogName;
}

void Dog::setWeight(int dogWeight) {
	weight = dogWeight;
}

void Dog::bark(int times) const {
	for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
		cout << "woof!\n"; 
	}
}

Dog::~Dog() {
	cout << "Dog destroyed\n";
}

//LoudDog subclass functions
LoudDog::LoudDog() {
	cout << "Loud dog made\n";
}

void LoudDog::print() const {
	cout << "IM LOUD AS " << decibels << " DECIBELS!\n";
}

void LoudDog::bark(int times) const {
	for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
		cout << "BARK BARK!\n";
	}
	Dog::bark(2); //Call bark method from dog class
}

LoudDog::~LoudDog() {
	cout << "loud dog destroyed\n";
}

int main() {
	LoudDog myDog;
	myDog.setDecibels(70);
	myDog.print(); //"IM LOUD AS 70 DECIBELS!"
	myDog.bark(); //BARK BARK! (x5) [and] woof! (x2)
	return 0;
} //Destructor called
```
