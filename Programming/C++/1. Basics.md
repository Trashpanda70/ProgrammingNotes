### Hello World!
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
	std::cout << "Hello World!"
	return 0;
}
```

### Compiling
- To compile a single cpp file
	- `g++ -o file file.cpp`

### Differences With C
- NULL is referred to as `nullptr`
- Do not need `.h` on headerfiles anymore
	- `#include <iostream>`
	- To use functions from libraries, need `using namespace X`
		- `using namespace std;` for standard library
		- Or can do `using std::cout;` (for example) to only use functions you need
			- This is preferred as it does not import the whole namespace [See Explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1452721)
		- If this is not done, need to do `namespace::functionName` for each use
			- `std::cout`
- Can print output with `cout` and the `<<` operator. Can read input with `cin` and the `>>` operator. For the difference in operators the arrows point to where the data goes to 
	- `cout << "Hello"` (data goes to cout and prints)
		- Use `cerr` for standard error
	- `cin >> x` (data goes from cin to variable x)
	- Can have multiple `<<` operators stacked
		- `cout << "Hello World! " << "My name is " << name` 
			- assuming name is a defined variable
- C++ supports function overloading, including functions with the same name and number of parameters (but params are different types/order)
- C++ supports default values for arguments, but these need to be the last arguments of a function
	- Default values for arguments should be in the declaration, not definition (if they are separate)
	- `void print(string str, int times=1) { ... }`
- Note that `cout` flushes the buffer, so it is better to simply end with a `\n` character for speed.
- To import headers from C in C++ do not add a `.h` at the end but rather a `c` at the beginning
	- `#include <stdio.h>` becomes `#include <cstdio>`

### Namespaces
Provide separate scopes for variables, functions, and other things
- Namespaces can be nested, and are usually defined in a header file
- If the same namespace name is used in multiple header files, both files will contribute to the same individual namespace
- Can reference individual functions/variables in a namespace with `namespace::identifier`
	- Do this in header files. **Never put "using namespace" in a header file**
	- It could cause problems for cpp files that use the header
- Example Below

**test.h**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
//best to avoid this like "using namespace" but is convenient for demonstration and small projects
using std::cout; 
using std::endl;
namespace outer {
    namespace inner {
        void foo() {
            cout << "This is inner foo" << endl;
        }
        int x = 5;
        namespace moreinner {
            void bar(int x = 0) {
                cout << "This is inner-inner bar. Param is " << x << endl;
            }
        }
    }
    void foo() {
        cout << "This is outer foo" << endl;
    }
}
```

**test2.h**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
namespace outer {
    void bar() {
        std::cout << "This is bar\n";
    }
}
```

**test.cpp**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "test.h"
#include "test2.h"

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using namespace outer;
//printed output is next to the line
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
    bar(); //This is bar
    foo(); //This is outer foo
    inner::foo(); //This is inner foo
    printf("x is: %d\n", inner::x); //x is: 5
    inner::moreinner::bar(); //This is inner-inner bar. Param is 0
    inner::moreinner::bar(5); //This is inner-inner bar. Param is 5
}
```

### Strings
Unlike C, C++ has a String class that can be imported with `#include <string>`
- Strings and their functions are also in the `std` namespace
- Define a string by using `string name = "value"`
- Can use `+` for concatenation and `.append` to change the value
- Can also use `+=`

**String Methods**
- `length` - Get the lenth of the string
- `size` - Alias of length
- `clear` - Clear the string
- `empty` - Test if the string is empty
- `replace` - Replace parts of a string
	- `str.replace(x, y, str2)` - Replaces y characters starting at index x of `str` with `str2`
	- `str.replace(x, y, str2, a, b)` - Replaces y characters starting at index x of `str` with b characters starting at index a of `str2`
		- Essentially grabs a substring from str2 to replace the part of str with
	- Essentially start at x and y is exclusive end
- `swap(str)` - Swaps the string with string `str`. The lengths can differ
- `substring` - Generate a substring 
	- `substring(x)` - Substring from index x until the end of the string
	- `substring(x,y)` - Substring of y characters starting at index x
- `compare(str)` - Compares the two strings. 
	- 0 means equal
	- <0 means first string is before second
	- >0 means second string is before first
- `c_str` - Get equivalent C string
- Find Functions
	- `find(str, idx=0)` - Find the string `str` and start searching at `idx` (which is 0 by default). Returns the starting index of the occurence
	- `findr(str, idx=0)` - Same as find but finding the last occurence rather than the first
	- `find_first_of(str, idx=0)` - Find the first occurence of any of the characters in str
	- `find_last_of(str, idx=0)` - Find the last occurence of any of the characters in str
	- `find_first/last_not_of(str, idx=0)` - Find the first/last occurence of any of the characters not in str

### References
References are like pointers that cannot be reassigned once set and cannot be null.
- Defined using an ampersand `&` after the type
- Can reference like a normal variable, will just reference the memory of where a variable is.

```cpp
using namespace std;
string foo = "I am foo"
string bar = "I am bar"

string& fooRef = foo; //reference to foo
fooRef += ". Hi!"; //modifies foo using reference
cout << fooRef << endl; //"I am foo. Hi!"

cout << &fooRef << endl; //prints address of foo

//Do not reassign references as it will not have the desired effect
fooRef = bar;
cout << &fooRef << endl; //prints address of foo still
cout << fooRef << endl; //"I am bar"
```
